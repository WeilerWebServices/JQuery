							<p>The overlapping functionality leaves web developers to choose between native options and JavaScript based widgets. In this talk we'll discuss the pros and cons of each approach to help you decide which makes sense for your application.</p>

And what is up with the turf warfare over functional vs. OOP?</p>

We also see people shifting from centering their applications around jQuery, to using it as a dependency in an MVC-style app. Let's chat about how you might build a large application with jQuery, how you might modularize your app, and how you might deploy it for optimal speed. Big surprise, Alex is talking about large apps and jQuery. Expect some Backbone, Require.js, and a few boring network graphs.</p>

							<p>JavaScript is a highly flexible language where practically anything can be modified. This property makes JavaScript a versatile and fun language to use, but it can also be an obstacle for library developers who want to write consistent, tightly encapsulated code. In this presentation, I will share techniques for writing high-integrity JavaScript. We will explore various ways to implement private state in JavaScript, how to harmonize private properties with prototypal inheritance, common security problems and solutions, and tips for hardening code to run safely alongside third party scripts. We will also take a look at the future of the language, ECMAScript 6, and the tools it will provide for writing securable JavaScript.</p>

Even seemingly-trivial anti-patterns like commented-out code, mixed spaces and tabs, or missing documentation can be "broken windows" that lead to further decay and software entropy in your large jQuery projects.

							<p>While many developers only dare to read source when available documentation just isn’t enough, even for those perfectly documented libraries, gems, and frameworks, reading the source code has huge benefits. It not only gives us a better understanding of how the code behaves, it changes how we think about and write our code. In this talk we’ll start leveling up our programming skills by dissecting some source code.</p>

								A/B Testing: How To with jQuery
							</h5>
							</hgroup>
							<aside>
							<p>We've all attended meetings where the designer and the copy editor can't agree on a critical part of your web application. They each argue their case before the boss, who ultimately chooses. However, since no customers attended the meeting, how would the boss know the best choice?</p>
							<p>The solution? Perform an experiment on some of your customers as test subjects. Show one group *Choice A*, and another group *Choice B*. Easy, right? Just remember, the grouping needs to be well distributed as well as random, and you'll need to measure and report the results.</p>
							<p>Multivariate Testing (also called A/B or Split Testing) lets you determine the best "choice" by showing a choice to a subset of your customers and measuring the results. Of course, you've already heard about it since Google has been doing these sorts of experiments for years, but how to begin? Does this require backend support or can this be done completely in jQuery?</p>
							<p>If your company is anything like mine, you'll have many concurrent tests, so make sure not to pick on some customers too much, or you'll skew the results.</p>
							<p>I'll show you the tools you'll need and code you'll write, with plenty of examples and a jQuery A/B Testing plugin. I'll share tips and tricks from the trenches to improving your customer experiments, and making your decisions more scientific.</p>

That's not what this talk is about, though, because none of it will save you: in spite of your tests and your best practices, your app *will* fail in the hands of your users and it will do so in ways that surprise you.</p>
							<p>I will instead discuss what to do when it all goes sideways. I'll show you how to detect failures in the first place, what to tell your users and when, and how to gather the forensic data available in the browser. Finally, I'll demonstrate Reanimator, an experimental framework for capturing and replaying failures in JavaScript applications.</p>

								I Like My jQuery Plugins Warm and Toasty: Wrapping jQuery Plugins with Backbone.js

							<p>With Backbone, don’t leave your jQuery plugins shivering out in the cold production air. We can keep them warm and toasty in a coat of Backbone view goodness. Gone are the days when we just copy and paste plugin files and start hacking in our script tags. Now that we have the expressiveness and modularity of Backbone views to manage our application behavior we can build a reusable facade for jQuery plugins. I’m going to provide a guide to wrapping our jQuery plugins cozily in Backbone views.</p>
							<p>I’ll be giving you an alternative to large spaghetti .render() methods that make every jQuery plugin initialization call. I’ll walk you through the key tactics in decomposing a plugin into it’s core functionality and explain how to flexibly build your backbone view. We will also discuss the best patterns and styles for wrapping different kinds of jQuery plugins. Most notably, I’ll be going through the process of wrapping jCarousel in a Backbone view that can be reused in many different situations.</p>

							<p>Welcome to front-end development in node.js! As more applications are built in node, front-end devs need to make them beautiful, generally using the node front-end toolkit. But what are the tools? How do you get started? What if you've never used node before?</p>
							<p>Join me as we use Express to spin up a simple node server and serve up a super basic index page. Then we'll use Jade and Stylus to layout and style it. Finally, we'll all chuckle about how easy it was and begin scheming about what we'll do next!</p>

							<p>Our code is unlikely to ever have the popularity and widespread use of jQuery. Especially for those of us in larger companies, imitating jQuery’s API or using plugins directly may not actually be good for us. I’ll talk about our JavaScript API design principles at Gilt and give examples of how we have built wrappers around some jQuery-like APIs. This has allowed us to take advantage of great code in the ecosystem, while also keeping our own front end APIs consistent and better suited to our specific needs. I’ll help you determine when this might be a good idea and how to do it.</p>

							<p>Building a website is like building a house: First, you build the foundations, then you install the wiring and plumbing, then you put up the walls, before finally decorating. Each of these steps requires the right tools and, more importantly, the know-how to get the job done right.</p>
							<p>However, even the most experienced contractor keeps a multi-tool handy, ready for the myriad situations when it will be useful.</p>
							<p>As jQuery has grown to become one of the most widely used software libraries on the planet, so too has consternation and resentment about how it should be used and by whom. Two of the familiar refrains are "it's too big!" and "anyone who uses jQuery doesn't know JavaScript!" In this talk, I'll explain why much of this criticism is off-base, show where jQuery really fits into the modern web application development workflow, and how its versatility can help make better 'contractors' out of us all.</p>

							<p>jQuery Mobile has amazing cross-device and cross-browser compatibility, lending a native feel to many mobile browsing experiences. Sometimes you want your awesome jQuery Mobile application to be downloadable from a native app store, for these times you turn to Phonegap. In this talk I will discuss everything from how to setup a jQuery Mobile application with Phonegap to not only make the application feel native, but also will show how implementing the native functionality that comes with Phonegap can fit easily and seamlessly into your jQuery Mobile application. Along the way we'll discuss Remote debugging techniques as well as some gotchas, such as iOS URL whitelisting, and how to programatically allow for opening URLs outside of your WebView.</p>

			<p>2013 will be our biggest conference year yet! jQuery will be taking over a huge section of the Oregon Convention Center. If you haven't been to the OCC before, you're in for a treat! As the largest convention center in the Pacific Northwest, we'll have 3x the space we've had in the past. That means more breathing room in sessions and lots more hang out hallway track space.</p>
			<p>Looking for a place to stay? The DoubleTree Portland is the official hotel for jQuery Conference Portland 2013. The team, board and speakers will all be staying there, and we'd love for you to join us.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>We've negotiated a discounted rate with the hotel, which will be available while supplies last, or until May 31, 2013. Please note that our hotel blocks almost always sell out, so book your rooms early!</p>
			<p>In order to receive the group room rate, attendees must use the group code JQ6. Reservations received after the cutoff date or after the room block is sold out (whichever comes first) will be honored on a space-available basis at the prevailing rate of the hotel. All rates are single/double occupancy and do not include the local and occupancy tax.</p>
			<h2>Getting around Portland</h2>
			<p>
				Travel Portland has graciously provided jQuery Conference attendees with free passes for the <a href="http://trimet.org/howtoride/max.htm">MAX light rail train</a>, <a href="http://trimet.org/howtoride/streetcar.htm">Portland Street Car</a>, and <a href="http://trimet.org/howtoride/bus.htm">buses</a>. These passes are good for the duration of the conference, June 12 - 14, 2013. Passes will be available at Registration, upon request. You  will need to carry the pass to board the train, car or bus.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the day of your arrival, take the <a href="http://trimet.org/maps/railsystem.htm">MAX Red Line</a> to the DoubleTree, take the Lloyd Center stop. The cost for this one way trip (a two-hour pass) will be $2.50. You can also purchase a day pass for $5.00 if you plan to use MAX later the same day.
