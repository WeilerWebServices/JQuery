			jQuery is one of the most widely-used tools on the Open
			Web, and its users have broad exposure across the
			discipline of front-end development. The goal of jQuery
			Conference is to bring together experts from across our
			field to bring you up to speed on the latest in jQuery,
			jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile, and a whole lot more. With
			subjects ranging from emerging browser
			technologies like push notifications, web components,
			and responsive design to test and build automation to
			software development workflow, jQuery Austin is a great
			opportunity to become a more well-rounded web
			application developer and get to know colleagues and
			peers from around the world.

						<p>jQuery continues to evolve to meet the needs of web developers. House cleaning in jQuery Core 1.9 and 2.0 has whittled away the fat and cruft from the API, plus the ability to create custom builds means you don't need to load what you don't use. When performance problems arise, however, it's important to understand how your use of jQuery can affect performance. We'll bust a few myths about what makes web pages slow and use some readily available tools to identify the real performance killers.</p>

						<p>There's more to jQuery UI Widget development than just calling <code>$.widget</code>. This talk will discuss techniques that will help you get more of jQuery UI Widget Factory-based widgets, especially in mixed front-end environments, including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>General rules and best practices about widget development.</li>
							<li>Providing unlimited arbitrary event publishing for your widgets at runtime.</li>
							<li>Using a centralized pub/sub registration structure to truly componentize your widget interdependencies.</li>
							<li>Mixing it up with other frameworks -- how to keep our widget business logic in one place and make it play nicely with other frameworks (Backbone, Knockout, etc.) through modular hot-swapping of items like data structure, transport, templating, etc.</li>
							<li>Exposing functionality for testability -- a lot of people tend to pass callbacks anonymously, and don't expose widget functions properly for testing. We should be writing them in a way that both our unit tests and our widget factory can make use of them with ease.</li>

						<p>With an ever widening pipeline of web capable devices, the previously clear line of mobile vs. desktop platforms is blurring. Touch screens can now be found not only on smartphones and tablets, but also on laptops, desktops, and even smart TVs. And thus, web developers are left with a difficult task of building pages that look good and function well on all platforms.</p>

						<p>In this talk, I will share my experience in using jQuery Mobile to try and create pages that provide the best user experience regardless of the device. I will focus on:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Making the pages look good on any size screen;</li>
							<li>Not penalizing small screen device user with watered down content;</li>
							<li>Providing intuitive touch functionality on touch enabled devices.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>While the examples utilize jQuery Mobile, the general ideas could be easily applied to creating pages with other frameworks.</p>

					<h3>Lunch in Downtown Austin</h3>

					The ACC is right in the middle of downtown Austin, deep in the heart of Texas, which mean that the sheer deliciousness of the options surrounding us for lunch is simply too much for us to make a call on what'll best suit your fancy. We've opted to give you a nice healthy chunk of time to have a nice <del>un</del>healthy meal at any one of the many Austin-tatious restaurants within a few blocks' walk.
					We've compiled a small list of some of our local favorites. If you care for our two cents, the hot dogs at Frank are can't-miss
					(especially if you've never had one) and Ironworks offers classic Texas BBQ and does not even require crossing the street.

						<p>As Stack Overflow fills up with questions like "Why would I use 'em' instead of 'px'?" or "Why would I use a 'for' loop instead of a 'while' loop?", it's become more and more apparent that the foundations of learning (and mastering) basic HTML, CSS, and JS can unfortunately be overlooked during the learning process. This can lead to even bigger problems down the road in a developer's career. Teaching people is hard though, and effectively teaching them the answer to "why?" is sometimes even harder.</p>

Conferences are inspiring, but it can be difficult for us to leverage new concepts without some fundamental, yet simple tweaks in our approach to projects and in our relationships with designers and clients.</p>
						<p>Drawing on practical examples from client work at Jet Cooper, a Toronto-based UX and development agency, this talk will describe the building of a collaborative process that addresses these common developer concerns. By involving developers from the beginning of a project, building in time for learning and prototyping, and strengthening cross-team collaboration,  we can not only improve project workflows, but also build a more developer-friendly culture. As a result, we can push technical boundaries, increase the quality of our applications, and help us keep our sanity!</p>

						<p>It is no secret the benefits that jQuery has to offer the web community.  Its easy-to-use event management, DOM traversal and manipulation have completely changed the way we write Javascript and has also had a pivotal role in Javascript's recent transition into a first class programming language.  What most people don't realize, however, is that it can also be used in conjunction with other exciting Javascript technologies to create powerful web automation tools.</p>
						<p>In this presentation, Travis will walk you through how jQuery can be used in conjunction with an incredible headless browser technology called Phantom.js.  When pairing these two technologies together, you get a fantastic testing and automation framework, but we won't stop there... by mixing these with the backend Javascript framework called Node.js, we produce an extremely powerful testing and automation framework that is both efficient, fun, and easy to use.</p>
						<p>So let's make some awesomesauce by combining three of the most exciting Javascript technologies together!</p>

						<p>A computer that can talk to us has been part of science fiction for a long time. For a number of people it has been a reality for quite a while: Those with limited or no sight at all, usually referred to as blind computer users.</p>
						<p>Making web sites and applications work for people that rely on a screenreader poses many interesting challenges. Usually there is no budget for accessiblity, as the number of users affected is small - exceptions apply wherever websites have to conform to regulations like Section 508 (aka Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). Even when there’s a budget, or just a rogue developer who cares, there a barriers in specifications, tools and testing, that make it hard for the average developer to improve the overall result.</p>
						<p>At the same time, although the targeted group of users is relatively small, it's this group that often benefits the most from a web service, since it can give them a form of independence they might not have in their day to day life, often more than able-bodied users do.</p>

		<h1>Training: Mon Sep 9</h1>
		<p>Whether you’re just starting or have been using jQuery for years, this class is a
		great fit for those with questions about core jQuery concepts. You should be
		comfortable looking at jQuery and JavaScript code, and experience using the command
		line is also beneficial. Registration begins at 8:00 AM. Training sessions run from
		<strong>9:30 AM</strong> until <strong>6:00 PM</strong>, with a break for lunch,
		which will be provided on-site.</p>
		<h2>jQuery Essentials</h2>
		<p>We’ll cover topics such as:</p>
		<ul>
