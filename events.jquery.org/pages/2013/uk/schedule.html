					<h2>So you know jQuery. Now what?</h2>

					<h2>jQuery is a Swiss Army knife (and that's OK!)</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						Building a website is like building a house: First, you build the foundations, then you install the wiring and plumbing, then you put up the walls, before finally decorating. Each of these steps requires the right tools and, more importantly, the know-how to get the job done right.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						However, even the most experienced contractor keeps a multi-tool handy, ready for the myriad situations when it will be useful.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						As jQuery has grown to become one of the most widely used software libraries on the planet, so too has consternation and resentment about how it should be used and by whom. Two of the familiar refrains are "it's too big!" and "anyone who uses jQuery doesn't know JavaScript!" In this talk, I'll explain why much of this criticism is off-base, show where jQuery really fits into the modern web application development workflow, and how its versatility can help make better 'contractors' out of us all.

					<h2>Taking Control with Machina.js</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						Are you losing control? Are you tired of creating more if/else statements when you add new features to your application?
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						I'd like to introduce you to machina.js, a Finite State Machine (FSM) library for JavaScript that helps you take control of your application's complexity. From handling offline/online statuses to simplifying complex initialisation and workflow processes, machina.js can help you streamline application flow and reduce conditional logic.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						Through this session, you'll find out about the many ways you can leverage machina and learn how it can be integrated into some of the frameworks you're already using. Even if you've never built an FSM before, this session will give you what you need to start using machina to take control.

					<h2>How to use events to glue full-stack frameworks together</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						As an industry, we've learned a lot about single-page applications and established a collection of tools and best practices to make them easier to work with. Full-stack frameworks add even more new possibilities and challenges to this collection but they are still evolving. What if we want to get our hands dirty without waiting for them to stabilise?
					</p>

					<p class="lead">Enter the solution: events through JavaScript.</p>

					<p class="lead">
						Events form a common thread through Node.js, jQuery, websockets, and even MVC. In this talk we'll look at how a full-stack application can be created from these various pieces and how the humble event can be used to glue it all together. You'll learn what you need to implement events as a solution to your framework solutions.

					<h2>Wait, Chrome DevTools can do THAT?</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						You may not realise it but your browser is one of the best and most instrumented development platforms. Sure, you can inspect the source, walk the DOM, fiddle with the CSS, and even evaluate some Javascript expressions, but it keeps many more instruments at your disposal.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						In this talk we'll take a whirlwind tour through an array of Chrome DevTools' best tips, tricks, and hidden features, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Remote debugging capabilities (debug your mobile apps on your desktop)
						</li>
						<li>Powerful JavaScript debugger and profiler</li>
						<li>CPU, memory, CSS layout and GPU profilers</li>
						<li>Built-in network monitoring tools: monitor at socket level</li>
						<li>SourceMaps, pretty print, revision control and autosave</li>
						<li>Data export and import: HAR, timeline, snapshots</li>
						<li>
							Custom extensions, customisable stylesheets, and much more...
						</li>
					</ul>


					<p class="lead">
						By the end of the tour you'll be more able to identify your performance bottlenecks, debug your apps, and enjoy a smoother workflow.

					<h2>Faster DOM manipulation with category theory and wield</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						The jQuery methods in Core do a lot of work. They handle a seemingly endless number of argument types and collection traversal. As if that wasn't enough somewhere in there they also perform operations on DOM elements. Sometimes a single method can encompass a page or more of code.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						In this talk we'll use a simple formalism in Category Theory to identify a fundamental separation of concerns for jQuery methods and derive a library to leverage its benefits.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						Don't worry. You don't need a background in mathematics to benefit, just a basic understanding of jQuery and a desire to make your DOM manipulations faster.

						Complex clientside apps and legacy browsers (a story of frustration...)
					</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						Sometimes, as a developer, you'll find yourself in situations where you need to design and build for old browsers. I'm in one of them. However, despite the frustration it's made me a much better JavaScript developer. Stockholm syndrome? I don't think so.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						Most of my time at Digital Science is spent building stateful, clientside UI's tailored to bleeding edge browsers and learning steadily as I go. However, I never learnt or grew so much as when I was faced with the challenge of building a UI that worked in every browser that could be thrown at it. It changed me.
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						One day you will likely face the same challenge. I want to share what I learnt so that you can be more ready for that day and finish it with more hair than I did.

					<p class="lead">
						Old browsers will always make your life harder. However, I'll show you the merit in working with them and help you become a better developer in the process.
