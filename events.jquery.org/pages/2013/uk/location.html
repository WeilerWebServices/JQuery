			<section class="transport">
				<h3>By car</h3>
				<p>
					Oxford's Park &amp; Ride is the easiest way to get into Oxford City Centre by car - believe us!
				</p>
				<p>
					With five car parks located around Oxford's ring road and fast and frequent bus services until late evening, it is the only sensible way to travel into Oxford City Centre.
The nearest is the Seacourt, just off the A34 Botley Interchange. You will need to get off at the Osney Island bus stop on Botley Road, from where The King's Centre is just a 5-10 minute walk along the Thames towpath (marked by a dotted line on our map.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note there is no parking space available at the venue. While there is parking in the city centre, it is very expensive and Oxford's one way system makes it a challenge for newcomers.
