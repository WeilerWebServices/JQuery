      <p>In addition to two days of jQuery sessions, weâ€™ll once again be offering a day of jQuery training, on the Friday before the conference. To start, we'll be offering Beginner Training, provided by our friends at <a href="http://bocoup.com">Bocoup</a>, and all proceeds go directly to funding the future growth of the jQuery project. Additional advanced trainings may be added as well.</p>

You&#8217;ll learn about jQuery collections, event delegation, deferreds, and more. You&#8217;ll even learn the basics of creating your own jQuery plugin. And at only $299, it&#8217;s a great .val() too!</p>

			<h2 class="table-heading" id="html-training">Intro to HTML5 <a href="../register/#training">Register Now &rarr;</a></h2>
			<p>HTML5 is the next major milestone in HTML and it's not just another incremental enhancement; it represents an enormous advance for modern web applications. A large number of HTML5 features are already supported in browsers, so it's time to start using them!</p>
			<p>In our HTML5 for Programmers Workshop, you will learn how to create HTML5 web pages and web applications using semantic HTML5 markup and cross-browser HTML5 JavaScript APIs. After completing this course, students will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Know how to use semantic HTML5 Markup</li>
				<li>Know how to use cross-browser HTML5 JavaScript APIs</li>
				<li>Understand current browser support for the various HTML5 features</li>
				<li>Understand how to polyfill HTML5 features on older browsers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our training takes a step-by-step approach, solidifying fundamental concepts and building on them to leave each attendee with a more thorough understanding of HTML5. Using a 50% lecture / 50% lab format, attendees will be able to put the concepts they have just learned to use after each section.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML5 Overview</li>
				<li>Using HTML5 Today</li>
				<li>Markup</li>
				<li>Forms</li>
				<li>Canvas</li>
				<li>Video and Audio</li>
				<li>Drag and Drop</li>
				<li>Geolocation</li>
				<li>Web Storage</li>
				<li>Web Workers</li>
				<li>Communication and Web Sockets</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="table-heading">Preparation</h2>
			<p>Attendees should bring a laptop with WiFi and a power cord, ready with a code editor and and browser. We strongly recommend the Google Chrome browser, although the latest Firefox (with the Firebug extension installed) will work in a pinch.</p>
			<p>We also recommend one of the following text editors for Mac: TextMate, MacVim, Coda or Windows: E TextEditor, Notepad++, UltraEdit, but the most important thing is that attendees use a text editor they're comfortable with.</p>
			<p>This course is designed for software developers interested in designing, creating, and deploying HTML5 web applications. It is valuable to developers that already have experience in developing web applications. To get the most out of the course, you should be familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
			<p>Prior exposure to any of these concepts will be helpful, but not required: AJAX, XML, jQuery, HTTP, REST.</p>
