By employing sizzlin' CSS selectors, and adding some more, jQuery allows us to target elements in a document based not only on parent, child, and sibling relationships, but on attributes, values, states, and relations the target  elements do or do not have.    You don't even need to have access to the site's HTML because there is no need to add classes and id's. When you know and understand the power of selectors, you can pinpoint any element on the page. Bonus is, this helps you with both jQuery and CSS.     In this workshop we'll cover all the selectors, basic to advanced with emphasis on the advanced, including selectors unique to jQuery and those new to CSS3.

This visibility into browser performance has generated many web performance best practices as captured in tools like YSlow and Page Speed.    The performance evolution that took place on the desktop (tools and research resulting in best practices) is starting in mobile. Right now we\u2019re at step 1: gaining visibility into what\u2019s happening in the mobile browser. Without this visibility, mobile web developers are flying blind.

Meet $.Deferred, the feature that satisfies all of these needs. Think of it like callbacks on steroids. Plus, it's already used by $.ajax() for asynchronous awesomeness.      We'll cover the basics of creating and using Deferreds and bring those principles into application architecture.

Another tool that works well with Mockjax is mockJSON which provides a random data templating feature. This can be very handy when you want to mock a JSON response from a AJAX call, but instead of manually building the response you can build a template to do it for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you are developing, Mockjax can also be used to help Unit Test your front-end code.
