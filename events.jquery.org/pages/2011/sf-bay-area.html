	      <p>In addition to two days of jQuery sessions, weâ€™ll once again be offering a day of jQuery training, on the Friday before the conference. In response to popular demand last year, we'll be offering two training tracks -- Beginner jQuery and Advanced. The training is generously offered by our friends at <a href="http://jupiterjs.com">JupiterIT</a> and <a href="http://bocoup.com">Bocoup</a>, and all proceeds go directly to funding the future growth of the jQuery project.</p>
