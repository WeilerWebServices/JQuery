						<p>jQuery continues to evolve to meet the needs of web developers. House cleaning in jQuery Core 1.9 and 2.0 has whittled away the fat and cruft from the API, plus the ability to create custom builds means you don't need to load what you don't use. When performance problems arise, however, it's important to understand how your use of jQuery can affect performance. We'll bust a few myths about what makes web pages slow and use some readily available tools to identify the real performance killers.</p>

							<p>These days, publishing a project without a comprehensive test suite is frowned upon. However, the tests themselves do not always tell the full story. We need to level up and provide a more confident level of dynamic code testing. In this talk, two types of such analysis will be covered: code coverage and run-time complexity profiling. Code coverage is instrumental in deciding the quality of the existing sets of unit tests. An important aspect of coverage testing, branch coverage, plays an important role in discovering possible latent bugs due to untested code flow. In addition to code coverage, complexity profiling permits selective instrumentation of a particular code block for the purpose of performance analysis. More than just measuring elapsed time, run-time profiling also needs to reveal the algorithmic complexity which can be tracked via this empirical approach.</p>

						<div class="talk_abstract">
							<p>jQuery gained notoriety largely because of how seamless it made writing code that worked everywhere. But times have changed, and the browser landscape is radically different - and far more standards compliant - than it was in 2006. We can now select elements with querySelectorAll, animate elements with CSS, and even attach event handlers without forking our code.</p>
							<p>This standards proliferation has led many to conclude that jQuery's job is done; we can map $ to querySelectorAll and get on with our development lives. They argue that reimplementing these native features adds unnecessary bloat and weight, especially in the context of limited mobile browsers and networks.</p>
							<p>In this talk we'll debunk these myths of irrelevance and bloat. We'll see that even in a browser utopia - a mystical land where all features are implemented, all bugs are fixed, and unicorns roam free - jQuery is not only still relevant, but it remains a foundation for any web development stack.</p>

							<p>REST web services are everywhere! It seems like everything you want is available via a web service, but getting started with one of these web services can be overwhelming – and debugging the interactions bewilders some of the smartest developers I know. In this talk, I will talk about HTTP, how it works, and how to watch and understand the traffic between your system and the server. From there I’ll proceed to REST – how REST web services layer on top of HTTP and how you can expect a REST web service to behave. We’ll go over how to monitor and understand requests and responses for these services. Once we’ve covered that, I’ll talk about how OAuth is used for authentication in the framework of a REST application. I will cover http monitoring tools for multiple OS’s. When you’re done with this talk you’ll understand enough about REST web services to be able to get started confidently, and debug many of the common issues you may encounter.</p>

						<div class="talk_abstract">
							<p>Managing the order in which asynchronous callbacks in JavaScript occur can be a nasty business. Without a lot of overhead and management, you're never quite sure that a certain callback has succeeded or failed. One technique for handling this problem that has gained a lot of traction in the past year is to use deferreds and promises. In fact, if you're using jQuery 1.6 or later and making Ajax calls, you're already using deferreds and promises.</p>
							<p>In this session, we'll look at how deferreds and promises bring order to the chaos of multiple asynchronous JavaScript calls -- often known as ""callback hell."" We'll start by understanding the problem of asynchronous work in JavaScript. The solution to this problem that jQuery provides are promises. A brief explanation of promises and deferreds will then be covered to give you a solid understanding of this key construct in JavaScript application development. We'll then look at the basics of both promises and deferreds in jQuery and then move on to see how you can leverage promises when making network requests, animating a page, loading content on the fly, waiting for long-running requests to complete, and more. Finally, we'll wrap up with a brief look at promises in other environments, like Node.js, and how promises are being integrated into the core JavaScript stack across browsers and virtual machines.</p>

							<p>Many developers use popular JavaScript code analysis tools (e.g. JSHint, UglifyJS, the RequireJS Optimizer) in their workflows, yet don't know how to create similar tools for themselves.  This talk will cover what JavaScript Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are, how to use ASTs to create powerful node.js and client-side tools, and why you are smart enough to use them.</p>

						<div class="talk_abstract">
							<p>For 5 weeks, I worked with a small team of developers to refactor the front-end of a moderately trafficked website for a ubiquitous international brand. The project’s initial launch deadlines were tight, and sacrifices were made to get the site out the door. Months down the road as features were added and changed, performance began taking a major hit, with page load times reaching 15 seconds. Some of this was attributed to poor front-end practices. Implementing new features became a somewhat of a nightmare, and morale on the team dropped. Given the opportunity to refactor and rework a portion of the site, we planned and worked for several weeks. In the end, we shaved 75% off page load times, eliminated a ton of technical debt, and set future work up for success by modularizing our code. This talk will cover some of that process. What worked for us, what didn't, how schedules and priorities between developers and clients can conflict, and how to make that better. We’ll also cover several things you can do right now to clean up your front-end code and optimize for performance.</p>

						<div class="talk_abstract">
							<p>You've got the hang of this whole JavaScript thing. Your code works on ancient browsers, and positively sings on new ones. AMD, SPA, MVC -- you can do that stuff in your sleep, amirite?</p>
							<p>But now your users are trying to type in your Very Important Form, and nothing is showing up; you loaded Backbone into your app *right there on line 1*, but `window.Backbone` is nowhere to be found; that widget that's supposed to end up in a certain div is showing up somewhere completely different; calls to jQuery's `.css()` are doing absolutely nothing; and, rarely but not never, your app just doesn't load at all.</p>
							<p>You *thought you had the hang of this whole JavaScript thing, but now you're in the world of third-party JavaScript, where all you control is a single script tag and where it's all but impossible to dream up every hostile environment in which your code will be expected to work. "It works on my machine" has never rung quite so hollow.</p>
							<p>In this talk, we'll take a look at some of the delightful bugs we've had to solve at Bazaarvoice while working on the third-party JavaScript app that collects and displays ratings and reviews for some of the world's largest retailers. We'll also look at some strategies for early detection -- and at some scenarios where you are just plain SOL.</p>

							<p>Making a website or application accessible can be an overwhelming task for a lot of developers, especially if you’re not already an expert.  Looking at all the complex regulations, specs, and articles on the topic, where should we begin?</p>
							<p>In this talk, I’ll walk through some of the challenges I faced when working through accessibility requirements for the first time. I’ll cover basic considerations, how design and content fit in, testing advice, and introduce Aria practices.  Attendees will leave knowing some of the practical constraints and tools that can make a big difference for users, and will have a starting point of how to make their next project more accessible.  By thinking about accessibility as we would any other feature, it becomes less of a scary unknown requirement, and instead something we can plan for and implement to create a more open web for all.</p>

							<p>Keeping frontend code cleanly decoupled is challenging at the best of times. Rich user interfaces often depend on complex interactions between program state, control values, and AJAX requests, which makes it hard to write correct and testable code.</p>
							<p>One technique for handling this complexity that is gaining favor in some circles is Functional Reactive Programming, which provides powerful tools for manipulating and composing streams of events and values that change over time.</p>
							<p>Using the working example of a simple Flight mobile web app, this talk will introduce the fundamentals of functional reactive programming and show how it can greatly simplify complicated UI logic.</p>

							<p>Prolonged load times can avert users from your beautiful site off to those other ghastly but fast-loading contrivances. Even if your site renders like a wildebeest escaping its hunter on your souped-up Mackbook Pro, the size of your dependencies can still be a concern for other devices on slower networks. This very concern has led to the fabrication of tiny javascript libraries which are slender phantoms of the amply-tested. And many third-party libraries require jQuery unnecessarily and have yet to realise they have the potential to slim down their dependencies. We'll talk about the recent changes to the jQuery source and how you can personalise jQuery to fit into that dress.</p>

The toolset had to be crafted in a way that allowed us to take a forward approach while still supporting the use of some legacy code and not-so legacy code. In the end, we created a toolset that separated new and on-going development tasks, gave living documentation and usage examples, and also allowed us to focus on maintainable and testable code. In this talk, you will get an overview about problems we tackled as well as solutions we found and approaches to creating a more maintainable codebase.</p>

							<p>A case study in how PayPal revitalized its tech stack by moving from Java, JSP and proprietary solutions to node.js and dust.js templating. Developer agility was our primary motivation, but along the way we had to tackle enterprise culture and teach people that JavaScript is no longer a ""toy"", but a powerful tool to wield.</p>
							<p>We showcase the technical hurdles we overcame, how we did it, and present the open source frameworks we released as a result of it.</p>
