Adam's development background consists of a degree in Computer Science and work in web development for both the insurance and technical support industries.</p>

<p>Adam is very excited about RIM’s adoption of the powerful WebKit browser rendering engine as well as the recent announcement to make the BlackBerry WebWorks Application Platform an Open Source project.  Both of these initiatives offer web developers better opportunities to leverage the full capabilities of community-driven JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery.  Adam looks forward to participating with the community in these initiatives in order to help push the boundaries of what is capable on the mobile web.</p>
