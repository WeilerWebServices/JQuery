			<a href="http://phono.com/"><img src="/resources/2010/boston/images/logos/voxeo-logo.png" alt="Voxeo - Phono" /></a>
			<p>Voxeo Labs is excited to announce the availability of <a href="http://phono.com/">PhonoSDK</a>. PhonoSDK is a simple jQuery plugin that turns any web browser into a multi-channel communications platform capable of making and receiving telephone calls and connecting to VoIP/SIP endpoints.</p>

			<p>PhonoSDK can also be linked to any <a href="http://tropo.com">Tropo</a> or <a href="http://voxeo.com">Voxeo</a> hosted application dynamically. Tropo allows developers to build sophisticated telephony applications like banking IVR systems that can be controlled by the user's voice but now from their browser using the PhonoSDK!  Forget about yesterday's click-to-call apps where you have to enter your phone number to get called back.  PhonoSDK now lets you place a call from the browser directly into your company's call center without downloading any software!  Imagine being able to integrate a softphone directly into your browser application. Now you can using PhonoSDK!</p>

			<p>PhonoSDK is 100% extendable, royalty free, and “skinable” to support your brand.  Downloadable demos illustrate jQuery controls for all buttons and actions allowing you and your organization extreme design flexibility and creativity to create browser-based phone and chat platforms to look and feel like your existing sites using your own images, HTML, and CSS.</p>
