      <h2>Hosted at Microsoft</h2>
    </header>
    <p>The San Francisco Bay Area conference will be held at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/usaoffices/northwest/svc.mspx">Microsoft Silicon Valley Campus Conference Center</a> in Mountain View, California</p>
    <p>This venue is the largest that the project has worked with to date (Harvard Law School in &rsquo;07, the MIT Stata Center in &rsquo;08 and New England Research and Development Center in &rsquo;09) and we expect to sell out very quickly.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;The jQuery team and community taught me in two days what would have taken me months to learn on my own. I cannot recommend this conference enough.&rdquo;</blockquote>

      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;The jQuery conference surpassed my expectations in many ways, from the talks that were both educational and fulfilling to acquiring new &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; friends.  Excited to attend the jQuery conference and being able to reunite with everyone :)&rdquo;</blockquote>

      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;Not only was jQCon Boston a great opportunity to learn new techniques for writing well structured and better performing code, but more importantly it was a chance to finally meet and thank so many developers I&rsquo;ve conversed with and learned from over the years. I wouldn&rsquo;t have accomplished what I have if it hadn't been for the self-sacrificing efforts of the jQuery Team and other jQuery developers that have given back to this wonderful community. I can't wait for the next conference!&rdquo;</blockquote>
