## Core
* Okay to make jQuery.access ([gh-2513](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2513)), jQuery.dir and jQuery.sibling ([gh-2512](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2512)) private?
  * Okay for UI and Mobile.
* [gh-2505](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2505): Degrading support for Android 2.3 in master: only guarantee successful interpretation and lack of exceptions (still fully supported in compat, as will be non-browser environments [[gh-2501](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2501))

## UI
* Finishing core-breakup, lots of rebasing of button rewrite afterwards
* Once that is done and button is reviewed and merge, we can release 1.12 (beta or RC?)
* Met with IBM about bidi contributions to jQuery UI, start with RTL support for datepicker rewrite.

## Mobile
* IBM Bidi will also be helping with jQuery Mobile
* Landing classes PRs
* Updated Collapsible
* Working on updating to UI download builder

## Chassis
* Build is fixed! :-D
* jsass landed, working on converting existing PRs to using jsass for variables
* Finalizing a lot of commonly used variables for use in media queries
* various build PRs to improve linting across project
* [Adding accessibility testing](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/114) w/ grunt-axe-webdriver [https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-grunt-webdriver](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-grunt-webdriver)
* Initial SCSS style guide, undergoing review
* Working on picking out default color scheme that is accessibility friendly
* Overall PRs are picking up and commits from outside the usual group is picking up
* Performance testing - working on getting that to apply to Chassis demos

## QUnit
* Going to release 1.19 soon

## PEP
* Decided to support CSS touch-action with style attribute and working around invalid style properties using mutation observers (which PEP already uses). Removes need to generate and inject stylesheets.
* John Dalton working on W3C test automation

## Globalize
* Runtime support close to land.
  * [Usage example](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/fix-398-runtime/examples/basic-globalize-compiler).
  * [Details about the compiler](https://github.com/jquery-support/globalize-compiler).
* Question: Separate distribution files for AMD and CJS instead of using UMD? [#467](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/467)
  * Original problem: webpack tries to use AMD (because it shows up first) instead of CJS: [#441](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/441)
* Twitter: Nicolas might be back from vacation. Need to resume talk.

## Other
* jquery-license now looks at all names for a given email address and outputs errors for “neglected” authors; remaining tasks are posting a comment on unsigned new PRs and checking for broken clones
* Good progress on js-reporters, implementing adapters and infrastructure to test those. [Still looking for feedback on proposed event data](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/12).
gitter
  * nice for the GitHub integration
  * makes cross-project collaboration harder unless everyone uses it
  * Maybe we can improve our GitHub integration on IRC instead? Timmy to look into that
