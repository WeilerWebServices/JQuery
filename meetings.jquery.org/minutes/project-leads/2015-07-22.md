## Core
* Alpha released!
* Waiting on more feedback to decide whether to keep show/hide changes
  * [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2308](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2308)
* Should we drop Android 2.3? Make it compat-only?
  * [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2483](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2483)
* 2.3 support in compat-only would be good for jQuery Mobile, if compat works for hybrid apps (will discuss at Mobile meeting tomorrow)

## UI
* Working towards 1.12 beta
* DB now supports CSS dependencies, major changes in place
* [AMD demos landed](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1557)
* [core-breakup almost done](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1569)
* Button remains, will rebase on top of core-breakup (once in master)

## Mobile
* Device testing of 1.5-dev
* More classes PRs landing
* PRs to update all of the test to new qunit API
* TESTS GREEN AGAIN!!
* Breaking up core files and accounting for ui core break up
* Almost 50 new PRs in last 2 weeks, plowing through reviews and landing

## Chassis
* [Starting to talk about using axe-core for accessibility testing for Chassis](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/99)
  * Within that discussion, what sort of accessibility testing should we do. Contrast testing is the obvious one, but there are other things we should test, too.
* [Initial pass at buttons using the agreed upon BEM naming convention](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/97)
* [JSASS landed to handle variables for both Chassis and Chassis Themeroller](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/89)
* Decision on the supported breakpoints made, will be variables so custom builds could adjust that
  * Have 4 breakpoints, $viewport-xs (400), $viewport-sm (768), $viewport-md (920), $viewport-lg (1200)
* Working on adjusting the tests (specifically csslint) for dealing with how BEM works

## QUnit
* Working on support for Map and Set; [only testing when available, otherwise skipping tests](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/834/files)

## PEP
* We started landing automated W3C tests using Intern and web driver.
* Discussion starting up around css touch-action
  * [Still waiting for feedback on suggestion to only look at style attribute](https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/151)

## Globalize
* Several in-progress PRs:
  * Runtime support: [PR#436](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/436) (writing documentation).
  * Tests using intern: [PR#450](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/450) (review).
  * Non-gregorian calendars: [PR#447](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/447); calendar conversion code should live somewhere else, maybe pull from iLib (which we can’t use, yet).
  * Extra datetime patterns:  [PR#462](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/462) (waiting for contributor to fix the reviews)
  * Webpack support: [#441](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/441).

## Other
* Board news?
  * EC meeting skipped yesterday
  * Looking for accessibility expert (see jquery-devs-team email from Kris)
  * Nothing new from the other initiatives
* Intern migration in progress on multiple of our projects, though nothing landed, yet. Globalize seems closest.
  * UI PRs need reviews
* CLA checks
  * jquery-license now rechecks previously failed PRs
    * only since the update was deployed, ignoring old PRs
    * not persisted on disk, list lost on restart/deploy
  * Will work on [matching all names for given email address](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues/32)
  * [Manual checks are possible already](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues/26), easy enough?
* browserstack-runner is alive again, now supports local server and should work (better) on Windows
* js-reporters is making progress, working on spec and [implementing adapters and reporters](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/tree/master/lib). [Still looking for feedback on spec proposals](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/12).
  * Alex will mention it to Colin, maybe that can get the stone rolling again
