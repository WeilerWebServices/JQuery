## Globalize
* Twitter team showed interest for [flask babel](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Babel/) approach that avoids needing to maintain a separate file of translation messages: related issue [yahoo/react-intl#89](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/issues/89).
* Rafael provided them an experimental full app showcase using react-globalize + runtime compilation for proof of concept to them: [React TodoMVC Example Using Globalize For Internationalization](https://github.com/rxaviers/todomvc/tree/react-globalize/examples/react-globalize#react-todomvc-example-using-globalize-for-internationalization)
* Twitter (Nicolas Gallagher) replied "That sounds great. I would be very interested in trying 'react-globalize' with the component api. I did think the authoring experience in the demo looked great, and I can see that you've put a lot of effort into Globalize. Plus, our i18n team had a preference for Globalize and I would like them to be happy too :)."
* Which sounded great so far.
