* Landed a couple of updates on [JavaScript Globalization overview page](https://github.com/rxaviers/javascript-globalization/) and created a gh-page [http://rxaviers.github.io/javascript-globalization/](http://rxaviers.github.io/javascript-globalization/).
* Waiting for license approval to use [slexaxton/messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js/).

## Chassis
* First 2 meetings have occurred, working on getting more involvement.
* Selected Project Name: Chassis
