## Core
* Moved to Github issues
  * Trac is still needed, not working well
  * Migration supposedly being worked on
  * Will migrate open tickets
* New versioning coming, two packages
  * jQuery-Compat 3.0.0 (like 1.x branch)
  * jQuery 3.0.0 (like 2.x branch)
  * Same API, now follow semver
  * Dropping browser from -compat deserves a version bump?
* Use fetch() rather than $.xhr()?
  * it's an okay API
  * There is a shim: [https://github.com/github/fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)
    * shim only supports IE10+, also not Android 2.3
  * Should we move IE9 and Android 2.x to -compat?
  * not sure how to integrate such a shim though
  * perhaps we could include it in a custom build tool?
