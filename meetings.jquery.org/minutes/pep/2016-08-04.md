* Use `InputDeviceCapabilities.firesTouchEvents` to detect mouse events from touch events

* `InputDeviceCapabilities.pointerMovementScrolls`
  * http://wicg.github.io/InputDeviceCapabilities/#dom-inputdevicecapabilities-pointermovementscrolls
  * Let's say you have a carousel that you would swipe with a finger, but could select text with a mouse (and then use buttons to navigate). Instead of using `pointerType` to detect that and limiting it to `touch` and `mouse`, you could check if the pointer would normally cause scrolling.
* Adding direction-specific `touch-action` values: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`
  * https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/6
  * Edge has agreed to add them, but it will take them about a year.
* Changing pointer capture from a modification of event targeting to a modification of hit testing
  * Chrome team will create a branch of the spec that changes the behavior
* Would like to see implicit capture for all pointer types, but there is concern from others that implicit capture for mouse will break the web
  * https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/125
  * Created a Chrome extension to mimic implicit capture
    * https://github.com/scottgonzalez/implicit-pointer-capture
* Adding events around `:active` style
  * https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/124
  * So you can programmatically detect if a button would still be clicked if you released the pointer, based on how much movement has occurred since pressing down
* `gotpointercapture` will now always be delayed until the next pointermove. `gotpointercapture` and `lostpointercapture` will always copy their properties from the event that caused them to be fired.
