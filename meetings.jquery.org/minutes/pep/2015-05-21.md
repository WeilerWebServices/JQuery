* Stuart proposed a PointerMap update
  * Two approaches to choose from:
    * Map: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/189
    * SparseArrayMap: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/190
  * Use sparse array implementation
  * Using an object, while more straight-forward, is actually slower: https://jsperf.com/performance-of-array-vs-object/17
* Stuart working on dispatcher improvements
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/188
* No PEWG call this week
  * Still waiting to discuss Web Driver tests and events after pointer capture is released
