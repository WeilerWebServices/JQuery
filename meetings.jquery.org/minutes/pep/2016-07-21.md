* Pointer Events Hackathon
  * Next week, so no PEP meeting
* Update the README during releases
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/249
  * Scott sent a pull request
    * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/306
    * Merged
* Support CSS `touch-action` instead of custom attribute
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/151
  * Setting `style.touchAction` as a property is preserved in all browsers, only the `style` attribute is sanitized by the browsers.
    * Even changing styles via `style.cssText` and `setAttribute(‘style’, …)` doesn’t kill custom properties on the `style` property.
