* Need a way to allow native scrolling while also doing custom multi-pointer gesture recognition
  * Perhaps add `touch-action: single-point` or similar
  * If the second pointer is delayed, only allow custom handling if scrolling has not begun
  * The spec currently states that this is explicitly out of scope: https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#h-note25
  * Alex will post a proposal to the public-pointer-events mailing list
