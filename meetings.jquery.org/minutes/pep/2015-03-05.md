* New Intern PR from Colin
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/167
  * Fixes bad test completion
  * Adds Travis CI support using BrowserStack to launch browsers
  * Shows some failing tests
  * Should add a method for spawning the browsers locally without specifying BrowserStack credentials
    * Can use grunt-selenium-server or we can write a tunnel for Dig Dug
    * Scott and Alex to work on a Dig Dug tunnrl
* Release script
  * Scott has started working on this
  * We need a different name than PEP for publishing to npm
    * Should make sure the name is available on Bower as well
    * pepjs suggested, not too much interest in any name
  * Should we automate updating gh-pages or keep that manual?
    * Automate copying samples
