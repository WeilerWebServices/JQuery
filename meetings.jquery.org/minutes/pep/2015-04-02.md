* ES3 support
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/174
  * For now continue to rely on ES5 features
  * Look into a custom build that replaces the use of ES5 features that canâ€™t be properly polyfilled (to avoid the use of es5-sham)
  * Only a concern for less than a year, until Microsoft officially drops support for IE8
* W3C tests
  * Replace the test harness reporter with a custom reporter that accumulates the results and passes them to Intern
* Ready to release?
  * Do some manual testing first
* jquery/PEP vs. jquery.pep.js
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/176
  * Nothing for us to do
