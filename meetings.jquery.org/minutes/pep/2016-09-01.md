* Marius created a PR for passive event listeners and `touch-action`
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/309
  * Need clarification on "nearest ancestor with default touch behavior" from https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/#h3_the-touch-action-css-property
* Release a new version as soon as passive event listeners land
