* W3C test automation
  * Landed automated retrieval of tests in master
* Stefan Neubert submitted a W3C test for dispatching pointermove events for chorded button interactions
  * https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1949
  * Needs to be less brittle. Ideas?
    * Just ignore other `pointermove` events
