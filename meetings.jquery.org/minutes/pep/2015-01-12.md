* Testing
	* Currently using Mocha and Chai
	* Adopt Intern
		* Provides non-simulated events through Webdriver API
		* Compatible with Chai
	* Colin available to answer any questions about Intern and assist with implementation.
	* Jacques to work on initial implementation.
	* Would be nice to run W3C tests, but they require user interaction.
		* Can manually run them on occasion to verify proper functionality.Nom
		* Can skip anything that involves capabilities that a device doesn’t have, like multi touch on IE8
* Browser support (overlaps with testing)
	* Adopt baseline from jQuery UI/Mobile? Currently means IE8+
	* Or stick with IE9+, provide hooks to implement IE8 support elsewhere, probably using jQuery events
	* Need to at least test that the polyfill doesn’t crash IE8
	* Need to automate tests with the jQuery wrapper in IE8, to verify the hooks actually work
* Project Lead
	* Volunteers or nominations?
	* Nominations for Scott
		* Scott willing to accept, but is happy to have someone take over at any point
* Scott replaced Polymer loader
	* Less crazy now, but should probably use a real build system
	* Go for AMD with r.js, instead of just concatenating files
	* Single entry point that includes everything in the correct order
* Schedule for future meetings
	* Weekly, reduce later if there’s not enough to discuss
	* Scott to send another Doodle
	* Fall back to today’s time if we can’t find something else
	* Create Freenode channel: #pep
		* Move notifications from #jqueryui-dev to #pep
		* Add to CONTRIBUTING.md
	* 10 minutes for planning, 50 minutes for venting
* Adoption
	* Planned
		* Dojo 2
		* jQuery UI
		* Intel App Framework (eventually)
	* Replace IBM’s dpointer?
		* Was supposed to go into Dojo 2
		* IBM will discuss internally
		* Requires support for AMD and IE9 (from last meeting)
	* Talk to about adoption:
		* Wikipedia
		* WordPress
	* MS Open Tech will promote it and contribute code, no immediate plans for using it
* Misc.
	* Rename repo to PEP
* Touch action
	* Filed issue: [https://github.com/jquery/PointerEvents/issues/151](https://github.com/jquery/PointerEvents/issues/151)
