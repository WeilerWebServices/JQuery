* ES6 modules are in master
* Added some people to jquery-devs-team
  * Still waiting on CLA signatures from many of the team members
* Perhaps we need a more formal commitment to determine who actually intends to be a team member and who is just interested in following progress
  * Scott to create an issue asking everyone to say how they’re interested in helping with PEP, then send an email to everyone who has expressed interest so far pointing them to the issue
* Still waiting on updated PR from Jacques for Intern testing
* No objections so far for using jquery-release, so we’ll go with that
* No update on formal objection to spec
  * Scott responded to Chaals’ post and requested that Yandex publicize their objection: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2015JanMar/0012.html
* Would like to test PEP against the W3C spec tests
  * Mostly manual tests, might be able to automate with Intern
  * Jacob might be able to run them in Microsoft’s lab using touch automation
* We should have a logo
