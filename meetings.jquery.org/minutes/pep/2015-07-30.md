* W3C test automation
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/207
  * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/208
  * Scott started review; John-David to make some updates and merge the two PRs into one.
* touch-action
  * Should we move to `data-touch-action` now?
    * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/209
    * No, see below for switch to `style`.
  * `touch-action=”none”` doesn’t prevent double tap zoom
    * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/211
  * Move to using actual CSS via inline `style` attributes.
    * Need to watch for `touch-action` being removed due to browser sanitization when doing `elem.style[prop] = value` and restore `touch-action` to its previous value.
    * This means that if a user wants to remove `touch-action`, they’ll need to set the value to `auto` instead of removing the rule.
    * Alex to send a PR
  * README still lists “scroll” as a possible value
    * https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/210
    * Should remove the list of values and link to the spec.
