In-person meeting in Portland, OR, after jQuery Conference.

Attending: Timo, James, JÃ¶rn

## QUnit Roadmap
* Release 1.12 soon. [Just one open ticket for that milestone](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues?milestone=1&state=open).
* Do all other deprecations in the next one or two minor releases.
* [Release 2.0](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues?milestone=2&state=open) with some breaking API changes, but including a migration layer that makes it easy to find invalid usage.
* Remove that migration layer in 2.1

## Infrastructure Roadmap
* Improve grunt-saucelabs, potentially replacing TestSwarm
* Until then, keep TestSwarm and Jenkins running
* Also enable TravisCI for PR testing, though without cross-browser coverage (was already enabled for QUnit and Mobile)
