- QUnit 
    - Released 1.18, including AMD support and improved diff module 
    - Leo focusing on open PRs, should be able to address all of them in more 1.x releases 
    - 2.x should be pretty trivial, just replacing some functions with deprecation errors 
- browserstack-runner 
    - Added QUnit/AMD support 
    - Still working on improved stability. Random errors on their end cause tests to time out eventually
