- July 17th - July 30th, 2015 author: Franziska Carstens 
    - Done Last Week 
        - added test infrastructure 
            - we can now run `npm test`  
            - Travis CI integration  

        - started [#20](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/pull/20), [#21](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/pull/21), [#22](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/pull/22) 
        - finally understood JavaScriptâ€™s Function.prototype.bind ;-) 

    - To Be Discussed 
        - #20 (see discussion there) 
        - #21 do we need a build script? 

    - Next Steps 
        - remove test.skipped 
        - implement start Events with suite and test objects 
        - try to add QUnit to the test script 
        - complete #21 (either build script or sed.js) 
        - complete #20, #22
