- QUnit
	- For the jQuery Summit we did a triage closing some issues.
	- 2 new PRs from the jQuery Summit already merged. Thanks @rdugue and @arghgr!
	- We started using waffle.io, seems fine so far: https://waffle.io/jquery/qunit
	- @gibson042 is now a team member. Welcome!
		- Waiting his update on qunitjs.com/about to announce on twitter.
	- @leobalter will finish the work on the logging interface at jquery/qunit#644
	- We will investigate how to bring LoDash's \_.isEqual to replace deepEqual, probably bundling QUnit using webpack or browserify. That opens the path to use other methods like \_.create. Ref jquery/qunit#865 and jquery/qunit#869
- js-reporters
	- Fixed a build process.
	- no more updates
