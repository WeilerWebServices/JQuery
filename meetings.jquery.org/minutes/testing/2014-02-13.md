- reporter interface that we can share with other testing tools
	* to make it easy to integrate into karma, browserstack-runner or grunt plugins
	* needs a data format ala JUnit XML (maybe ala tap?), that is flexible enough to support QUnit and others
	* reporters should be built on top of this format: console, html etc.
	* need to do research for this - how do other test frameworks and their integrators currently handle this? What are the differences?
- assertions cleanup
	* what do we really need to keep?
	* make equal/notEqual() strict and drop strictEqual/notStrictEqual
	* deprecate/remove ok()
		* need to research how ok() is used, and document what to do instead
		* like ok(array.indexOf > -1) -> notEqual(array.indexOf, -1)
- make it reasonable to compose assertions
	* at least expose the traversal of QUnit.equiv
	* maybe expose an API for custom assertions that fixes stack traces when delegating to other assertions?
	* or try to have the assertion wrapper/constructor keep track, so that it doesn't matter on what level you call assertions, it'll unwrap correctly
	* or try and see what happens if we simplify the stack trace handling - a few more lines might be worth removing the complexity
- async tests!
	* references: mocha, nodeunit
	* force calling done like nodeunit? make that configurable?
	* grunt style async() method that returns a callback which you run when done?
