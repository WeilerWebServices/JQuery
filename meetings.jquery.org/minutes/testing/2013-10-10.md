Location: #jquery-meeting on Freenode

Attending: Timo, James, Jörn

## QUnit
* Timo working on source split, will rebase assert work on top of that. In the future, a build step is necessary, as in jQuery Core
* Provide “grunt watch” to quickly rebuild “dist/qunit.js”, which unit tests will reference


## TestSwarm
* A few [fixes landed](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/commits/master)

## Testing infrastructure
* Timo updated TestSwarm browsers: Firefox 21/22 to 23/24, added Opera 15, added iPad w/ iOS 5.1 and iPhone w/ iOS 6.0
