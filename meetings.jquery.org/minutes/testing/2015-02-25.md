- QUnit 
    - Leo prototyping to test ES6 features via Goiabada: [https://github.com/leobalter/goiabada](https://github.com/leobalter/goiabada) 
    - babel works well for transpiling ES6, but to output browser-compatible code we need another step; browserify doesn’t support UMD, still need to solve that 
    - alternative: disable babel’s es6.modules transform, then use esperanto to transform to UMD 
    - Scott to put together a test 
- TestSwarm 
    - Moved to new server, seems to work fine 
- browserstack-runner 
    - Enabled browserstack-runner for Travis, including PRs, for QUnit repo 
    - Will do the same for Globalize once requirejs load issues are resolved 
    - jQuery UI takes 5+ minutes to run everything, times out before finishing
