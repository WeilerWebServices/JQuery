- QUnit 
    - Released 1.15 on Friday, need to update jQuery projects to use that 
        - jQuery Core is messy, was working before (with 1.15-pre), now has lots of failing tests 
    - Timo asking karma-qunit team to loosen their peerDependency on QUnit, currently strictly on 1.14, which is useless 
        - [PR to update to 1.15](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit/pull/16) 
        - [PR to require &gt;=1.14 range](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit/pull/17) 
    - 1.15 removes undocumented QUnit.addEvent, need to update plugins that make use of that, for example [qunit-assert-html](https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-assert-html/pull/8/files) 
        - Removed methods from the QUnit object: addEvent(), id(), addClass(), removeClass(), hasClass() 
    - Leo experimenting with [console reporter](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/576) 
        - [tap is too verbose for humans, optimized for machine](https://gist.github.com/leobalter/b1fe1f7b34f37a809e2d) 
        - Maybe use a [module that eats tap and outputs userfriendly logs](https://github.com/substack/tape#pretty-reporters) 
- TestSwarm 
    - No progress on rerun handling, [#217](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/217) 
    - TestSwarm seems to be running fine, low BrowserStack worker loss rate according to reports in Splunk 
- Testing Infrastructure 
    - Micha≈Ç is working with BrowserStack people, asking for new releases in API and dealing with their failed experiment on real mobile devices
