Location: #jquery-meeting on Freenode

Attending: James, Michał, Oleg, Jörn

## Availability
* Jörn busy with lots of other projects, mostly jQuery UI, still working on esformatter
* James to ramp back up in October, go back to finishing node compat
* Timo busy with events and school, going to ramp up in October back to ~ 10h/week.

## QUnit
* Discussion about setup/teardown logging callbacks, triggered by this PR: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/471
	* We at least agree on adding a Per-test setup/teardown, defined at the page level
	* Maybe a Per-module setup/teardown, defined at the module level, for [something like this](https://github.com/jquery/qunit-composite/blob/36de4d690fe005ef24218ec0de82f96d60067cdc/qunit-composite.js#L114-129)
	* Syntax idea: Using QUnit.module( .. ).on(‘setup’, fn).on(‘teardown’, fn); ( or QUnit.module( .. ).on( { setup: fn, teardown: fn })
* Maybe have Assertion, Test and Module all be EventEmitter (instead of just QUnit) and propagate from the lower-level objects to the higher ones (re-using the event name and data parameters) 
* node compat
	* James to pick up on in October
* QUnit.Assertion and QUnit.on
	* Timo to pick up again in October

## TestSwarm
* Looking at new issues, a few people actually use TestSwarm: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues?state=open
* jQuery Core all green on master, very little failing on 1.x-master: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
* jQuery UI looks bad, but the team is working on docs, CLDR etc: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryui
* Overall it looks like we have very few infrastructure issues

## Testing infrastructure
* Need to add iOS 5.1, 6.1 & 7.0 for Core builds (or whatever BrowserStack can provide that’s close enough)
	* iPad 3rd 5.1, iPhone 5 6.0
* Add a separate run for Android 2.3, for manual runs, since the Android runs are very slow
* Looked at preview of BrowserSwarm, which runs QUnit tests through SauceLabs, has better output than grunt-saucelabs, but works more like TestSwarm
* Timo to prototype a grunt-qunit-saucelabs plugin that makes use of SauceLabs new [support for running unit tests](https://saucelabs.com/docs/rest#jsunit)
