- QUnit
	- Nested modules and QUnit.config.collapse are ready and will be landed with a new release for them
	- Leo is writing a blog post about the nested modules.
	- 2.0 Milestone is one step away (standard reporter interface for js-reporters)
	- Leo will work on a follow up for James' [Event emitter PR](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/644) (docs needed as well) based on [js-reporters](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters) specs.
	- With the event emitters we will be able to test js-reporters along.
	- as `QUnit.on`, `QUnit.register` or `QUnit.reporter` is better than a `QUnit.config.reporter`.
	- We've got a few [bugs](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/labels/bug) on the way. (#870 is a recent regression).
	- `QUnit.only` is not a blocker for the 2.0 Milestone (it does not break anything).
- js-reporters
	- We need more collaborators.
	- Bringing it to the jQuery Foundation might help.
	- We should also bring js-reporters to other test frameworks.
