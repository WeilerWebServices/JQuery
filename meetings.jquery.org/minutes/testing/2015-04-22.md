- QUnit 
    - [Module split](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/785) needs final review, should land soon 
    - [Diff optimization](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/802) can land, last discussion is resolved 
    - need to make progress on nested suites and jsreporters to get closer to 2.0 
    - [stdout reporter](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/790) looks good, found how QUnit ends up on the global object, once fixed this can land 
- browserstack-runner 
    - Still lots of timeouts, making the CI results unreliable, if not useless. Try to escalate that. 
- TestSwarm 
    - Added AMD support
