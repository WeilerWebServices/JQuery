## api.jquery.com
* Question: Should we make the examples from inside the descriptions work (currently using images, as these were from Karlâ€™s book).
* https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/829
  * Kark will go through the docs and add &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; elements for those images so we have something in place for iframe stuff

## Ongoing issues:

* Need to review https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/806
  * Aurelio fixed issues with the WP website (PRs have been and are being reviewed)
  * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/374 still needs to be reviewed
* New grunt-jquery-content feature allows to set up redirects in the repo (redirects.json)
  * Arthur working on moving all redirects from the infrastructure repo to the repos
  * Example: https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/108
  * Should be finished soon as there are only a few sites to go
* Status on the http -> https redirects?
  * We should implement
  * issues with mixed content so we need to make sure that refs to http are changed to https (example: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/118)
    * Arthur will take care of this if possible
