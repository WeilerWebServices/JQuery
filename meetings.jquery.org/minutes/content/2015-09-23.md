## Content:

* Need to review https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/806
  * Aurelio fixed issues with the WP website (PRs have been and are being reviewed)
  * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/374 still needs to be reviewed
* It would be good to get api.jquerymobile.com PRs for 1-5 to land in the 1-5 branch to lower the issue count

## Ongoing issues from 9th Sept
* Mobile Api docs will need to be updated to core 1.11.1 for mobile 1.4.5
* New grunt-jquery-content feature allows to set up redirects in the repo (redirects.json)
  * Arthur working on moving all redirects from the infrastructure repo to the repos
  * Example: https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/108
  * Should be finished soon as there are only a few sites to go
* Status on the http -> https redirects?
  * We should implement
  * issues with mixed content so we need to make sure that refs to http are changed to https (example: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/118)
    * Arthur will take care of this if possible
