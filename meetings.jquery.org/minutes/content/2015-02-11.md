## All Content Sites:
* Make reference to https: removes (now-deprecated) protocol-relative URLs in favor of https:// URLs
  * Also see https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/86 (slightly different issue)
  * Demos in api sites and learn should be easy to copy/paste and work without editing, so replacing protocol-relative with https:// makes sense here.
    * Will need to add a note/warning to ajax examples that will not work with file:///
* Api sites:
  * Mobile: update core version to 1.11.2
    * https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/358
  * UI: Do nothing
  * Core: update to latest version
    * https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/651
    * v3 changes will be in a separate branch

## Repos at healthy cadence:
* We aim to have less than 5 issues or be closing more issues than we open on all content-related repos
  * We continue to make good progress. Big thanks to everyone!
