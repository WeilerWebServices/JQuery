## Content:
* Mobile Api docs will need to be updated to core 1.11.1 for mobile 1.4.5
* New grunt-jquery-content feature allows to setup redirects in the repo (redirects.json)
  * Arthur working on moving all redirects from the infrastructure repo to the repos
  * Example: [api.qunitjs.com/pull/108](https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/108)
  * Should be finished soon as there are only a few sites to go
* Status on the http -> https redirects?
  * We should implement
  * issues with mixed content so we need to make sure that refs to http are changed to https
    * example: [jqueryui.com/issues/118](https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/118)
    * Arthur will take care of this if possible
* Globalizejs docs: a new contributor has offered to help :-)
