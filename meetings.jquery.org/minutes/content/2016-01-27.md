## Content:
* https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/698
  * We should update the PR to have all file types to use tab except for *.yml and package.json
  * We should also update all entries to makes sure we use tabs and not spaces
* What should we do with https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/530 ?
  * Pinged Timmy
* Should we see if the CLA checker can be made more clear? I think things like https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/854 could get even easier to handle.
  * Arthur will see if he can come up with more concrete suggestions
* Can we get someone from the infrastructure team to look at https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/690? (Strange behaviour of some redirects)
