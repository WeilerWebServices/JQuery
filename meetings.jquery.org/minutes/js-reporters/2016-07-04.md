12:00 UTC (noon), IRC, Freenode, #jquery-meeting; attending: JÃ¶rn Zaefferer (project lead, GSoC mentor), Florentin Simion (GSoC student, working on js-reporters)

- First meeting!  
- Since the start of the program: Created an extensive testsuite to thoroughly test all 3 adapters. Rewrote all adapters, fixing a lot of bugs in the process. Meanwhile migrated from esperanto to rollup. Update tap-reporter to TAP 13, adding tests for that as well 
- Last week: Focus on [getting js-reporters adapters into browserstack-runner](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner/issues/157). Discussed/reviewed issue in their existing tests. Trying to decide how to deal with older framework versions, built separate tests for those.  
- This week: 
    - Land [versions tests](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/pull/72), without CI. Can for now run it manually every now and then. Debug CI failure on node 6 later. 
    - Fix browserstack-runner integration, create PR 
    - Help searls [adopt js-reporters for teenytest](https://github.com/testdouble/teenytest/issues/15) 

- Later: 
    - Address issues with [nested suites](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/65) and [suite names](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/62) 
    - Reboot communication with Mocha and Jasmine 
    - Implement js-reporters support in QUnit
