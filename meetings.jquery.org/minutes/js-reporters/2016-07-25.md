12:00 UTC (noon), IRC, Freenode, #jquery-meeting; attending: JÃ¶rn Zaefferer (project lead, GSoC mentor), Florentin Simion (GSoC student, working on js-reporters)

- Last week: 
    - browserstack-runner PR got merged! 
    - Christoph Hiller (@boneskull) is contributing! Interested in integrating js-reporters in Mocha. Already helped review/design assertions properties. 
    - Implemented fullName prop, array with suite and test names, empty array for global suite 

- This week: 
    - Finish normalizing assertions (as part of [#80](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/pull/80)) 
    - Update spec, add details ([#30](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/30)) 
    - Add examples to readme ([#27](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/27)) 
    - Discuss tests emitting order ([#62](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/62)) 
    - Will update browserstack-runner to latest js-reporters once testEnd with assertions is released. Also to fix IE8 regression.
