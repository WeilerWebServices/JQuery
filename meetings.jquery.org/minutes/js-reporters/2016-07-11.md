12:00 UTC (noon), IRC, Freenode, #jquery-meeting; attending: JÃ¶rn Zaefferer (project lead, GSoC mentor), Florentin Simion (GSoC student, working on js-reporters)

- Last week: 
    - Landed versions tests, for now without CI integration. 
    - Update browserstack-runner integration to replace existing plugin with a single js-reporters plugin (except jasmine1). 
    - Fixed Mocha adapter to keep the original reporter in place, allows browserstack-runner to still have the HTML reporter output 
    - Published js-reporters 1.0 on npm 

- This week:  
    - Finish browserstack-runner integration: Fix loading js-reporters dist from node_modules. Fix globalSuite.runtime issue with Mocha adapter. Create PR, get it landed 
    - Once that PR is ready: Fix issues with [nested suites](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/65) and [suite names](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/62) 
    - Once PR landed: Reboot communication with Mocha and Jasmine
