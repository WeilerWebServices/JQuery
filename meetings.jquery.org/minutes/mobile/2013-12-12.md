## Official Agenda:
* Releasing 1.4 final on Monday


## Updates:

## Jasper de Groot
* Finished new jquerymobile.com


## Alexander Schmitz


## Gabriel Schulhof
* Re-basing 1-4 onto master
* Did a semi-automated rebase, but that may not be the best
* Doing a second re-base, this time even more manually, with regard to those commits that should also end up in an eventual 1-3 branch


## Ghislain Seguin
* Good progress on the jquery-release implementation for mobile
* Left to do is create the directory to receive the demos on the website and figure out how to send an automated email to Google with their CDN version.


## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* a few fixes on the demo site for the 1-4 release (content divs changed to the new format)
* produced a list of my commits that need to be in master (some however rely on previous commits): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZbjyoctmhfvJUb27EkGyoNvUjxSlYzVlbF0UUUJukw/edit
