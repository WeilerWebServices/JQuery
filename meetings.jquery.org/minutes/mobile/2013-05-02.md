* Attending: Todd Parker, Jasper de Groot, Anne-Gaelle Colom, Gabriel Schulhof, Alex Schmitz, Ghislain Seguin

## Todd
* Team is focused on 1.4 activities
* Joseph Wain (Glyphish.com) has offered to donate an icon set for jQM, I’m working on logistics. This would be an expanded set from what we have now, in vector format. [Proposed set](http://i.imgur.com/6MDW7BL.png)
* We’re tracking down the server issues for view.jquerymobile.com/
* Need help with the site re-templating and getting meeting notes published

## Jasper de Groot
* continued to work on “next”: [Branch preview](http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/)
* updating and cleaning up CSS of all widgets after all changes we made to the markup is done
* now working on centralizing padding and icon position CSS for buttons in all widgets; consistency, reduces CSS, easier for devs to adjust the button style global
* also changing from px to em values for left/right padding, etc.
* after that theme inheritance

## Anne-Gaelle Colom 
* Some triage/testing
* Scott G created a 1.4 branch so that we can get started on 1.4 specific docs (api doc)
* liaised with Scott & Karl and we now have a consistent class for “note/warning” in the api docs
* Minor fixes in the api docs
* A new entry for parseUrl in the api docs
* A new book and a new article on the resources page

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Bug fixing
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5956
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5935
* Bug re-fixing
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5893 - decided to centralize hashToSelector() function instead of placing escaped hashes into the DOM. We need to keep in mind that, whenever we use a hash/an id as a jQuery selector, we need to pass it through $.mobile.path.hashToSelector() before we use it to construct the jQuery object, because it may contain weird characters (like spaces, periods, commas, square brackets, braces, etc.)

## Ghislain Seguin
