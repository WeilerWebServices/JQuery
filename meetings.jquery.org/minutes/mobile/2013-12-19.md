## Official Agenda:
* We are in the middle of the 1.4 final release YEAHHH!!!
* New weekly meeting doc (starting 2014): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=sharing
* Next week no meeting because of holidays
* Way we work
  - New commit message standard: http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/#commit-guidelines (use same name for component as we use in issue tracker!)
  - Until further notice ALL commits to any mobile repo must be to a branch no commits to master.
* Planning
  - First focus on triage, PR reviews, bug fixes, cleanup branches (also API docs, ThemeRoller, Download Builder repos) - 1.4.1 release end of January
  - Wait with changing file structure and removing deprecated code until after 1.4.1 release
