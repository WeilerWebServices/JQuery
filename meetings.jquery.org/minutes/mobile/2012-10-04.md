* Preparing for the DC session this week

* There will be another maintenance release for 1.1 (1.1.2) in the coming weeks. Timing TBD
* Roadmap draft for the next year close to complete. We'll be refining this a lot as we go, but it maps out the general direction - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Roadmap
* Plans for UI integration/harmonization are in full swing for the next few months - 1.3 will tackle basic conflicts, 1.4 will include a harmonized tab widget from UI

## John Bender

  - merge next week
* Nav refactor
  - two event based approaches so far simple/full hash management
