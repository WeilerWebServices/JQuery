## Anne-Gaelle Colom 
* Liaised with Ralph regarding working on jquerymobile.com
  - Ralph pushed one PR this morning for the resources page
  - Most of the content is present, and just needs updating (big thanks to Ralph for porting all the content and style across from the old site)
  - Started updating the content:
    * removed the contribute page as we will use the generic jquery.org one instead
    * updated book list and apps & framework list
    * added a dev links section
    * added style for manufacturers icons and download section
  - We need to move old download compressed files to jquerymobile.com/downloads/ (just like UI)
