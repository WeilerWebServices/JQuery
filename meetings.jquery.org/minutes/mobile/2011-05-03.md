###Navigation re-write status update and planning
* URL handling:
  - in-progress, test written, code changes this week by Kin
* Extensibility hooks: need to document on wiki page

  - Steven Black will start a wiki page with suggesitons
* Caching: a simple "don't cache" flag per page
  - A new data-cache attribute on the page div to tell framework to re-load it if shown again, default is “true” (re-use the page) but you can set data-cache="false" to tell the framework to re-load ever time it’s viewed
  - $( "[data-role='page'][data-cache='false']" ).live( "pagehide", function(){  $(this).remove(); });
  - Issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1554
* Memory management: how to keep the DOM from getting too big?
  - A new global configuration option to set the max number of pages to keep in the DOM at once. Once that max is hit, we run a a document-wide $("selector").remove() at the appropriate juncture in every changePage invocation (post Ajax success) that finds all pages that are data-cache="false" or oldest in the stack and delete them. We’ll need to check for alreadyLocalPage = ("[data-url='...']:not([data-cache='false']")
  - Default to a sensible number like 15-20 pages but this can be overridden to any number more than 2 (to allow for transitions) or turned off completely
  - Issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1555
* Focus: can we handle this better?
  - we need to have focus brought to the top of the current page on transition for accessibility and keyboard/focus-based navigation
  - Scott Jehl will create a wiki page with suggestions
* Transitions: how to smooth out, eliminate blinking
  - Kin will tackle this after URLs
