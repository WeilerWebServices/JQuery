##BETA 2 ITEMS  

###All beta 2 issues here:
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=6

###Transition improvements - See “Transitions” branch
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1883

###Remove ajax-loaded pages after hide.
* Commit for branch here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/2265330677ca4ce1b3808112a7c5952cd555ca5e
* adds an option to the page plugin:
* ajaxDomCaching: false (default)
* will remove a page from the DOM when it is transitioned out, this will leverage the native browser’s cache to store pages
* if set to true, it will leave pages in the DOM as now
* we’d recommend leaving this off, but it can be turned on per-page via data-ajax-dom-caching=”true” on the page container
* need unit tests before pushing

###Add a data-prefetch attr to any anchor element and jQM will load it
* branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/prefetch
* basically a markup shortcut for $.mobile.loadPage
* new data-prefetch attribute, which can be applied to any anchor element in the page and trigger a pre-fetch request of that anchor's href url
* a great way to transition away from multi-page docs
* need unit tests before pushing

###Auto-init branch
* allows devs to delay the auto-init call until whenever they want to call it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/autoinit-option
* need unit tests before pushing

###pushState
* branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/pushstate-integration
* works in Chrome, Safari (?), Firefox, Opera 11
* issue in iOS to be worked on
* needs more work and unit tests
* planned for 1.0

###Decoupled widgets
