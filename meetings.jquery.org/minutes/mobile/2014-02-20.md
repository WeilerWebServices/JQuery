* External toolbars: min page height
  * External toolbars are dealt with inconsistently - when the footer is internal, the footer follows immediately after the end of the content. When the footer is external, the footer follows immediately after the page, which is sized as if there was no external footer. Slide transition doesn't work when there are external non-fixed toolbars.
    * we are going to substract external toolbar height from page heigt in 1.4.2
