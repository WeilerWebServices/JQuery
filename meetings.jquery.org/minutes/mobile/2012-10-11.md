* Attending: Todd Parker, John Bender, Jasper de Groot, Jason D Scott, Anne-Gaelle Colom, Gabriel Schulhof

## Todd
* Preparing for the DC session this week is the main focus
  - Tables for docs, triage/bugs, and 1.3 features (responsive table, panels)
  - Table leads will update the wiki with details before the conference
* We're carving out time to sit down with the UI team to start planning out the tab widget re-factor slated for 1.4 which will be a converged widget for UI and mobile

## John Bender
* Navigate all the things
  - second approach is winning in my estimation
  - simple navigate event
  - $.navigate (name up for debate)
    * tracks history
    * smashes url with replace state where possible
    * supplements navigate event by adding storable state to hashchange through history tracking

## Jasper de Groot
* flagged issues for DC summit:
  - label Dev summit + milestone 1.1.2: fixed toolbar and transition issues
  - label Dev summit + milestone 1.3: RWD tickets
* will open new issues on dev-summit repo that link to those and give them a table label
  - table 13 Mobile Triage - change into Mobile RWD?
  - table 14 Mobile Bugs
* still working on:
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045 (slider full width) - conclusion: we need to wrap input and slider in a div to do this, looking into impact of that change
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875 (IE10 transitions) - requires quite some changes in support.js to make it work with unprefixed props too

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* Completed listview (api docs)
* added dismissable to popup options
* Need to revert 34a32ee
* Added a few articles to the resources page
* Preparing todo list for DC (please everyone step in to add what needs documenting that is not a widget):
  - jQuery Mobile api docs
  - hashchange, controlgroup, degradeinputs, events, fieldcontain, grid, init, links, media, navigation,
  - widgets: header, footer, navbar, page loading widget
  - new logo, favicon
  - add missing examples to listview
  - add prefix to event types (in events) for all widgets. The rule is event type does not use prefix where we use trigger and not _trigger
  - change cdn to 1.2.0
  - general events that need to be documented outside of widget: position, virtual mouse eventsâ€¦
  - Fix FF bug (demo does not appear in automatically generated iframe with demo. Hand-made iframes are fine)

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Messed around some more with returning focus to button after popup closes. Focus management on WP7 is a disaster.
* Accepted PR for deactivating listview item link when such a link opens a popup
* Writing unit test for latter, seeing strange behaviour: unit tests explode when I open one more popup
* Do we cherry-pick new popup features into 1.2-stable?
* Found an iOS bug (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5155)
* Messed around with trying to visualize deps between files (dot sucks at it)

## Ghislain Seguin
* Looking at building an auto-complete demo - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5096
* Adding new feature to start listview blank for a local auto-complete - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5090

## Jason Scott
* Fixed issues related to the BlackBerry 10 theme
* Heads up - New BlackBerry specific css properties for BB10
  - -webkit-overflow-scrolling: -blackberry-touch;
    * Same as -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch but adds over scroll even when the region doesn't need to scroll (bb10 style).
  - ext-overflow: -blackberry-fade;
    * text fades with a linear opacity gradient left to right
