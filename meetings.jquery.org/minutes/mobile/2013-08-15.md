* Attending: Jasper de Groot, Alexander Schmitz, Gabriel Schulhof

Time: 2pm ET

## Official Agenda:
* upgrade guide, updating API docs and Demo Center, updating Theme Roller, new web site
  - Gabriel: updating API docs, move content from Demo Center to API docs
  - Alex: updating Demo Center custom JS
  - Jasper: upgrade guide, updating Demo Center custom CSS
* Let’s close (one way or another)
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5418 (degradeInputs adds options to page widget)
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4974 (move non-option constants to defaults object)
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5987 (Support for using jQuery Mobile without init module) - is it enough to write unit tests for each widget such that only the widget’s module is loaded into the unit test and a widget is instantiated directly in the body? The test would check to make sure the widget is instantiated correctly.
* Collapsibleset does not work on its own because it accesses collapsible’s initSelector (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsibleSet.js#L51) which is only generated if the page widget is loaded before the collapsibleset widget, because the page widget contains the $.widget shim for autoinit. I can think of two solutions:
  - Move the shim code into its own module, to be depended upon by anyone making use of initSelectors - probably collapsibleset and controlgroup
  - Assume that all the children of the collapsibleset are collapsibles and instantiate them all as collapsible widgets. In 1.3.x, we leave alone those children that do not match collapsible’s initSelector, however, is that an API promise?
