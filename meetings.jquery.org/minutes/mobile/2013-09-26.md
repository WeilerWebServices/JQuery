## Gabriel Schulhof
* Added CSS-related API entries (class list and theme overview)
* Fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6466 - Panel: Panel doesn't close by clicking outside if the page is scrolled down.
* Fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6498 - Marked $.mobile.getDocumentUrl and $.mobile.getDocumentBase as deprecated
* Peeled back https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6347 to find that it’s caused by inadvertently applying fixed toolbar workarounds to regular toolbars, and that querying window size on iOS 6 most likely causes spurious resize events.

## Ghislain Seguin
* Released 1.4, there are several steps that should be automated:
  - Upload to CDN
  - Upload of demos to website
  - Upload of the zip to the website

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
