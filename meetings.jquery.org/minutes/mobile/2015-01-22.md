      * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7927
    * Should we add a way of removing a handler? We could track handlers via ```$.data( "mobile-events" )``` like we do for swipe. Right now, we have to write code into callbacks to do nothing if they have become stale. What should the API be if we do want it? ```.animationComplete( callback, type, fallbackTime, remove )```?
      * Agreed against adding an argument to .animationComplete, and use ```$.fn.removeAnimationComplete( callback )``` instead
