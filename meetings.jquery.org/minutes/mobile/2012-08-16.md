* Attending: John Bender, Ghislain Seguin, Gabriel Schulhof, Jasper de Groot, Anne-Gaelle Colom

## Todd
* 1.2 status - hunting down last two WP7 critical issues (focus state,  scroll jump when closing popups) and confirming that Android forms with on-screen keyboard is 100% ok on all versions, now targeting for RC next week
* If WP7 issues aren’t fixable due to hashchange bugs in their browser, we may need to exlcude back button support on this platform.
* Targeting 1.2 RC1 late this week
* Roadmap prioritization well underway, will have public details within two weeks or so

## John Bender
* 2 highs, 2 criticals fixed
* Basetag work continues
* Helping infra get setup on Vagrant

## Ghislain Seguin
* Builder issue fixed
* Need a node.js to replace no.de instance it's running on now

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Popup issues - #4784 “fixed” on branch fix-4784 - gonna investigate why there are no problems if the overlay stays visible (as Wilto was experiencing)
* Android 4.0 hangage - rapidly running out of ideas. We may have to use the fix currently on master, but confine it to Android 4.0 via UA checking (à la fixedToolbar) - everyone else attaches the handler to the screen (rather than allowing the event to bubble up to document and handling it there)
* Observation: responsive-carousel inside a listview + “swipeleft swiperight” event handler = swipe-to-reveal

## Jasper de Groot
* No Updates (device issues), joining back in tomorrow

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* fixed a few issues on the api docs, need to add the event parameters to the existing widget pages
* Will be away for the next 2 meetings
