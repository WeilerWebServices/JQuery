  * Selectmenu keyboard navigation + fixed toolbar autohide/show issues
    * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514
    * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6028
    * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3184
      * The fix for [#5514](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514) is to blur() the select upon change. This fix is causing problems with the keyboard navigation. The fix was added so that hideDuringFocus might work for fixed toolbars. However, fixed toolbars may need to be notified that they need to reappear by means other than those of blur()ring the select upon change. The fix for [#5514](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514) causes regression [#6028](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6028) and preventing the type-to-select-option behaviour required for a fix to [#3184](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3184)
    * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7903
      * Partially addresses [#3184](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3184). I don't believe it is possible to fully fix [#3184](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3184), so this may have to be the final fix for it.
    * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7902
      * The hide-upon-focus for the fixed toolbar was not working in the case of a native select on Android 4.1.2. This fixes that, but it does not address the issue of how to re-fix the toolbar after the native selectmenu is dismissed without triggering change. The basic problem: We know when a selectmenu is opened (see [#7903](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7903)), but we don't know when it's closed.
