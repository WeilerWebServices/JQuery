## Todd
* Working on 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 maintenance releases - started keeping release notes here, working on a changelog (needs to be filled out). jlembeck is helping me automate the change log automation-  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.1.2-and-1.2.1-Release-Notes
* Making good progress on the 1.3 features and bugs - targeting end of the year.  
  - 37 open issues / 27 closed issues for 1.3 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
  - Collecting release notes here - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
* Open 1.3 Q’s:
  - Grid as widget - close? roll into navbar? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2126
  - Grid: should we handle colspans? Probably close - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5168
  - Other grid ratios - include in structure or make demos? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5164
  - RWD grid - include the class to stack blocks in structure css? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4955
  - Listview grid - Need to work with Keith Pepin on finishing this, prefer css only approach - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956
  - Transitions in IE10 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875
  - Sliding panels - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163
* Media queries in the library: how to do this consistently?
  - Current plan: include a basic RWD breakpoint in the structure CSS for widgets, but make this apply only if a class is added by the user. By using classes, it makes it easy for people to create custom breakpoints and not have to override ours
  - Need to decide on sensible default breakpoint and naming for these (ui-breakpoint)
  - Convert the form fieldcontain BP over to this class system - this will cause a lot of ripples for existing apps

## Jasper de Groot
* Gabriel and I finished our work on CSS corner styling, branch is merged
* reviewing and testing PR for new option clear button for text input https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5281
* pushed branch unprefixed-transitions with CSS for supporting transitions on IE10 - Mat is looking into transform3dTest() and validStyle() functions https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875
* cleaned up branches (see also Basecamp post)
* working on method demos for API docs
* working on table widget CSS (styling)

## Anne-Gaelle Colom
* api docs:
  - Changed select to selectmenu
  - Added example to silentScroll
  - Selectmenu now uses the generated examples for options
  - Some corrections/additions
* Finally got a good understanding of how to attach things to widget events, which will help writing the docs.
* Now need to update to a new version of grunt which will allow us to get automatically generated code examples for events (just like we can do currently for options).
* Need to write the getting started with jQuery Mobile guide for the Learn site.

## Gabriel Schulhof
* Added tests for form reset and select menu _destroy()
* sequence test random timeout trackdown continues
* Fixed some issues
  - Closed 4746 educating reporter on how to detect whether a widget has already been associated with a given element
  - Accepted 5287 (minor grammar fix in the demos)
  - Fixed 5288 based on the idea in PR 5290 by Krinkle
* Failed to reproduce 5285 (function $.mobile.media is injecting a fake style and body, but not removing it, thus rendering the page invalid) by installing Ubuntu 12.10 in VirtualBox.
* Short-circuited the unit test comparing our results from $.mobile.browser to core’s $.browser, because $.browser is gone in the git version of core
* Jasper addressed most of the options-vs.-defaults in https://docs.google.com/a/intel.com/document/d/1n7ozvhQTLhBj6sPR-LYxuev3p8kcbHjlAM8EBMlQ8GE/edit … a few still need eyes
