* Style option removal
  * Might increase CSS size, leading to longer startup time.
  * Certain widgets support certain options. If it's just classes, users might try to add any class to any widget.
  * Kangsik: There will be too many classes and too many ways of adding them - sometimes to ```data-wrapper-class```, sometimes to ```class```. It will be harder to use jQM.
    * keep non-bool style options like theme, icon, and iconpos; look into deprecating theme swatches for 1.6
* Collapsible collapsed/collapsed-icon/expanded-icon
  * Might be doable entirely in css with, maybe, like .ui-icon-expanded-plus and .ui-icon-collapsed-plus, etc., but again, it would probably add a lot to the CSS, increasing startup time.
* Shadow option
  * If we change the default to false, is there a way to provide a deprecation period?
  * We could add a shadow even if no class is specified, and then create a class ui-no-shadow to turn it off.
