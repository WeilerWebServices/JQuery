* Attending: Todd Parker, John Bender, Jasper de Groot, Anne-Gaelle Colom, Gabriel Schulhof, Alex Schmitz, Ghislain Seguin

##Todd 
* We’re focused on 1.4 development
* Decided to go with SVG icons based on Grunticon after testing because of it’s compatibility with ~100 devices/browsers: View test results
* Decide on final icon sizes (one vs. 2 size options), black/white, if we dont’ default to the disc bg, setting icons at the swatch level
* Ideally, we'd let you set per theme swatch: icon color (black/white), icon opacity (0-100%), disc (y/n) and disc color (any hex)
* New set from Glyphish with ~50 icons will be part of 1.4
* Team will be meeting in Portland next week
