* Effects Rewrite
 * https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1017
 * Mike asked for review, still pending.
 * Otherwise, two issues: 1. failing tests (which I think are faulty tests), 2. one of the effects actually needs to modify layout, so that one should use placeholder, but the placeholder should shrink accordingly
 * Any news since last week?
* Datepicker
 * Alex to test the rewrite on mobile and report issues. Inline datepicker seems like the wrong solution.  Status?
 * Determining what formats to support for min/max
    * Start with just date, determine how to handle strings with Globalize
    * Drop support for numbers, confusing compared to timestamps, and duplicative of "+2d" which can be handled through libraries like moment.js.
* Draggable
 * Dave and Mike to fix TestSwarm failures
