* Working on new API documentation site.
  * Need a [better index page](https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/21) that provides an overview rather than an API dump.
  * Need a way to [document stable public methods](https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/20) that aren't exposed via `.widget( method )`.
  * [all open issues](https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues)
* Menu's documented API is too large.
  * See notes above about stable public methods.
  * Most documented methods are not part of the "normal API".

  * The existing script for 1.8.x is written in bash.
  * The new script is being written in node using shells.
  * Should work for minor and major releases.
* Working on [download builder rewrite](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41505725/Download%20Builder%20Rewrite).
