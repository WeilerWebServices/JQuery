* Working on new API documentation site.
  * Need a [better index page](https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/21) that provides an overview rather than an API dump.
  * Need a way to [document stable public methods](https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/20) that aren't exposed via `.widget( method )`.
  * [all open issues](https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues)
* Menu's document API is too large.
  * See notes above about document stable public methods.
  * Most documented methods are not part of the "normal API".
* New widgets don't conform to icons option standard.
  * Menu's icon option needs to be icons.submenu.
  * Spinner needs to expose icons.up and icons.down.
* Finalize [manifest files](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/manifest/build) for inclusion in master.
* Started working on the [download builder rewrite](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41505725/Download%20Builder%20Rewrite).
* Need to write the new release script.
  * The [existing script for 1.8.x](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/build/release/prepare-release) is written in bash.
  * The new script will be written in node using [shelljs](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs).
  * Should work for minor and major releases.
