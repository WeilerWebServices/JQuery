* Tabs	
	* Hidden tabs can be navigated to via keyboard
	  * https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15013
	  * Automatically disabling tabs based on visibility would require additional complexity to track the fact that the tab is only disabled because it was hidden (so that it can automatically enabled when it becomes visible again)
	  * This doesn't seem worth the effort, the user should just manually disable the tabs
* Spinner	
	* Doesn't work with Globalize 1.x

* Selectmenu	
	* Doesn't work with numpad

	  * We're using `String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode)`
	  * We should stop using `keyCode` since it's deprecated

	  * Felix to send a PR
