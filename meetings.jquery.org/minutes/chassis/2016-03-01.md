* jQuery Foundation has been accepted into Google Summer of Code! Yay!
* Typography
 * Need to add basic styling for p, ol, li, ul tags.  PR for this to be submitted later this week based of the typography pr currently being worked on by geekman-rohit
* Outline should be styled so they're consistent for all browsers
* JSASS Style Guide
 * General rule moving forward - double quotes and hyphens for variable names so it is similar to how we name things in scss.
 * Need to update JSASS variable tooling, right now files are compiled alphabetically, which was a problem for buttons since it was being compiled before colors or typography
* [Variables: Initial pass on button variables ](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/138)
 * Center buttons vertically in Firefox.
 * Make the default button state change more obvious
 * Once this is done, commit
* [Typography: Add Variables](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/139)
 One small commit needed from geekman-rohit to follow the JSASS style guide, then good to pull in.
* Table Styling
 * kristyjy to start work on that this week
* HTML 4 Inputs
 * sfrisk has started working on this. To be submitted for PR later this week
