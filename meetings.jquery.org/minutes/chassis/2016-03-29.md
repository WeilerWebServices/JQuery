* JSASS
 * Travis seemed to run the wrong PR? Looking into a solution for whatâ€™s going on with Travis
 * Issue is node version not parsing ES6 syntax
* Namespaces for classes, not variables
* [WIP] Tables: Table styling
 * Working on switching this to class based, not element based
 * Currently up to date with what's in master
* RTL : Added CSSjanus to build process
 * Need to have RTL and regular CSS in one file so a site could support both options easily
 * Should go through existing scss code to figure out what needs to get flipped and what should be ignored
* Images : Basic styling
* Grunt: 'grunt watch' runs all tasks at beginning
* Grunt: grunt-watch now detects variable changes
* Initial files and initial demo styles added (inputs)
* Testing: Added Pure for sass unit testing #35
