Issues:
* Labels added to indicate phases for issue according to Chassis Roadmap
* [File Structure](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/29)
  * Initial commit landed, closed the issue so work can begin on CSS goals for Phase One.
* [Create Semantic Color Variable Names](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/43)
  * sfrisk and others added some suggestions for variable names for required colors for Phase One to be used for the themeroller/customization.  Prefer a smaller/simpler list of variables starting out.
* Next Steps
  * Styling for typography, form elements, form validation (will need color variables), html4 elements, tables, and finally Grid.
* [Create a Grid System](https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/5)  
  * Looking for a flexible grid, similar to suzy
  * This is a lower priority for Phase One, styling for other elements should be done first.
