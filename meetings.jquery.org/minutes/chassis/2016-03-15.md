* JSASS
 * Released stable version with new API Doc's and tests
 * Created grunt JSASS released
 * Working on PR for chassis but running into issues with Node sass
 * For future notice, if you have a variable file it depends on another variable file, you must put the dependency at the top of your file to get the order right
 * Future naming conventions for variables, have file names reflect the variable prefix (btn.js for variables starting with $btn- for example), also simplify prefixes
 * Don’t have variables that are just ‘default’ but say what they’re to “$color-default” for example
 * Update jsass to accept JS variable references to other variables, and output the SCSS variable
