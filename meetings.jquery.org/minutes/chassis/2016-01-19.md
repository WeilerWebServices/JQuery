* Typography: Add Variables #139
 * Initial pass committed, open for discussion. Decided to put anything that might be opinionated design wise into a variable, similar to what has been done so far on the buttons PR
* Buttons PR is now up on views.css-chassis.com
* sfrisk to do a palette commit to nail down basic colors and their active/hover/focus/disabled colors, since trying to adjust colors programmatically didn't look very good.
* kristjy to move current draft of the scss style to a google doc so the team can contribute, with the goal of having a finalized version of that up for next meeting
