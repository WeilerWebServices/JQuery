## Releasing TODAY!

## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2365 Remove or document array methods
  - I’ve found them useful and I still want to explore using them for selections again – it was removed accidentally before. Will save a loop.
  - Status quo seems like the best solution. We don’t want to remove them or document them. Documenting encourages usage and removing them is problematic.
