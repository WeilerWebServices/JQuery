## jQuery 3.0 beta
* Still a LOT to do
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+no%3Aassignee
* Can everyone get their assigned PRs done this week?

## Pull Requests and Issues
* Style of Support comments
  - https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/95
  - I'm good with gibson042 proposal, removing the "< N only" since "<= N-1 only" is clearer
  - Let's start using that now, and do a pass to clean up the existing comments
* .unwrap() conditioned by a selector
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2003
 - Please review
* jQuery.Deferred enhancements
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1996
 - Ready to land? waiting for jaubourgâ€™s review
 - Still need some way to signal unhandled rejections, gibson042 to make a proposal
* jQuery.parseHTML("")
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1998
 - I like the idea of doing more here but given how much we need to do for 3.0 I'm okay with just this change if nobody has time to take something more ambitious.
 - Let's ask Krinkle to update the PR for the more ambitious changes that track what the native method does, see comments in the PR from timmywil and gibson042
* Funny characters in tag names
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1988
 - Same here as with parseHTML, if someone can take it now we could do more but otherwise let's land this smaller fix. (But note gibson042 comments regarding colons for namespaces.)
 - Let's land this now (hyphens), do a second commit for the more general changes (unusual characters, namespaces)	
* Inserted scripts run async
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1895
 - Need to land a change like this for a 3.0 beta so people can see what might break (e.g., templates with embedded script)
* jquery-release tasks (timmywil)
 - Can these get done this week? Need at least some of them to ship the beta. (timmy says yes)
