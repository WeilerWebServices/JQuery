## JSHint, JSCS, ESLint
* Should we switch to ESLint completely?

## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2824 # in selectors
  - No revert
  - “be more careful with code changes that may introduce exceptions on invalid input, during code review, but not have a policy to test for invalid input”
  - “it doesn't mean we're not going to introduce exceptions, but we can make sure people have warning.” Moving an exception to major version may be appropriate.
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3060 Remove default Deferred callback context
  - Yes

## Migrate
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0
