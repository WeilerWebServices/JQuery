## Fixing the 3.0.0 milestone
* A non-trivial amount of issues backported to 1.12/2.2 had a 3.0.0 milestone
* m_gol looked at all 3.0.0 issues and changed the relevant ones, adding a comment: “This has been backported to `1.12.0` & `2.2.0` so I changed the milestone (it used to say `3.0.0`).”
* What should we do about those tickets? They weren’t mentioned in the 1.12.0/2.2.0 blog post, they won’t be mentioned in the 3.0.0 one.
  - Timmy can add them to the blog post if we compile a list
