## Schedule for 3.0
* Release target date mid-January
* Firmer dates once we get closer

## Style guide
* Please weigh in
* https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/94
* Would like to get JSCS support for whatever we decide

## Issues vs Pull Requests
* Any bug/feature/deprecation should have an issue
* Issues track the functional changes in the release
* Dave to go back and check tags/milestones for pre-3.0 commits
 - Think I need to create issues for pre-closed tix in Trac
* (discussion about whether it creates unneeded duplication)
* Could a commit message format change help here?
* Support for jquery-release
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/issues/1
* Dave to see how other projects deal with this for their changelogs
  - e.g. https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog

## Issues
* Remove .context and .selector
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1908
 - Just have jquery-migrate monkey patch it
* Is the guard around currentStyle.left needed? Probably not
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1906
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/8099cdce800d45109b961e3521fc0080e9a876c6
 - Might actually clean up the code nicely
