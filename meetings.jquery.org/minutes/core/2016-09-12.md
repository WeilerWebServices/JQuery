## 3.1.1
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.1.1 
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3260 CDN .map
  - Dave to work on it this week
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3072 & https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3003 
  - In progress, PR incoming
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3204 Edge 14 whitespace error
  - PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3308 needs review
  - Close. The issue has caveats that we don’t think merit elaborate workarounds in Core.
  - Dave to bug the Edge team to fix this.
  - Either ignore the failing test for now or skip in code until it’s fixed

## TestSwarm fails in Edge 14
* AJAX tests time out

## Edge for Windows 10 Mobile will probably not be added to browserstack soon
* Don’t worry about testing for now

## Finish up remaining 3.1.1 issues asap
