## Additional issue tracker things ##
* wontfix? (done)
* cantfix?
* needs review (team needs to review the issue/PR) (done)
* I don't think we want "fixed" or "notabug", too noisy and not particularly useful to search
* "valid and fixed" issues should be assigned to a milestone, be sure they are when committing code that closes an issue
* Always set a milestone when assigning an issue, and always assign the issue before closing with a fix/patch
* Always create an issue for a PR, so the issues have a complete list of the problems solved

## Branch naming still needs to be done ##
* rename "1.x-master" to "compat"
* also change name in package.json - “jquery-compat”
* handle 4 remaining PRs to 1.x-master, then remove the branch; PRs:
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1506
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1652
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1664
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1704
* don’t merge anything to 1.x-master from now on
* Both versions need package.json rename to 3.0.0-pre

## Issues and PRs in the 3.0 milestone ##
* What can be landed now?
* Promises/A+ compat
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1821
* gibson042 proposing a change for chained .done()
* m_gol to look into better integration with tests

## $.xhr -- replaced by $.fetch ##
* Let's do this as a plugin with its own schedule

## Issues and Pull Requests ##
* Assign milestones to all issues
