## Should we return null for attributes?
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2118
* Already have a PR (needs revision) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2129
* DOM attributes are always strings, so null vs undefined is arbitrary
* Matching the specâ€™d behavior is appealing
* try for beta and gauge breakage

## Combine our 2 branches and use build script to generate master from compat?
* Timmy thinks yes, but we should wait until after 3.0 for that significant an overhaul.
* Need issue opened
