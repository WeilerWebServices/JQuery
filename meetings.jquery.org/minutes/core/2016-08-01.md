## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3238 animate with radius/FF
  - Do we allow animating properties?

## PRs
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3247 gruntfile/eslint
  - Just wrap in runIfNewNode

## Wontfix wiki page
* Looks good
* Dave to add pointer from old page

## Migrate
* Approach for deprecated APIs in 3.2? Just warn and let them pass through, or warn and fill (and run unit tests?)
  - Resolved: just warn, don't fill or move/copy unit tests from core
  - APIs removed in core 4.0 can be filled in migrate 4.0

## Consider using Gitter instead of IRC
* Doing next meeting in gitter: https://gitter.im/jquery/jquery/meeting
