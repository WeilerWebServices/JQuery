*Note: Timmy on vacation Aug 31-Sept 21*

## Trac
* I will ping about that, i think they made progress last week

## Promises/A+ compat for jaubourg's pull request
* m_gol got it mostly working
* some fails related to invalid args
* need a solution for `dfd.done( fnThrows ).then( neverCalled )`
  - keep a separate list of callbacks for .then() vs .done()?
* need analog to Promise.unhandledRejection proposal from Domenic
  - http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2014-September/297601.html
  - (questions about whether onerror or unhandledRejections is best)
* see if jauborg and m_gol can finish this
* Promises error telemetry - Mike to reach out to Domenic

## $.xhr
* markelog and gibson042 to create some examples based on typical ajax usage
* review at next meeting
