## Alpha release retrospective (any issues to address next time?)
* Went pretty well

## Need to update our code-style settings, without breaking a lot of prs

## PRs
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2481 Android 2.3 not ES5-compatible
  - GTG
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2458 Android 2.3 not firing window.onerror
  - LGTM
  - Ask arschmitz whether we can drop 2.3. We’ve only ever had partial support.
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2480 Remove user data in cleanData
  - LGTM
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2479 avoid using delete for Chrome’s sake
  - I’d like to confirm this still noticeably hurts performance. It would be unfortunate if we have to do this.

  - LGTM
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2455 Authors.txt
