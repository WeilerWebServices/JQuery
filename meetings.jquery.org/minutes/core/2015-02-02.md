## timmywil to be new Core lead, gibson042 on Sizzle

## jQuery 3.0 beta
* Still to do
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+no%3Aassignee

* PR on spaces and style changes
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2030
  - Will wait for next jscs release

## Thinking about deprecation announcements for the next round
* Could also do some of this with good documentation warnings
* hide/show? https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/88
* jQuery.swap?
  - We already don't get reliable results on currently-hidden elements
  - Needed for the Android 2.3 reliableMarginRight fix
  - How important is it to keep that fix?
* :hidden/:visible selectors?
  - Update api.jquery.com first (reflows!)

## Use velocity.js as a replacement .animate() in 4.0?
* Not sure of the difference in file size, all the jQuery-like shims go
* Talked to Julian last week, he's interested in doing the integration if we want
* https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity
* Famo.us folks say they will try to do benchmarks for us
