## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3982 outerHeight, -margins
  - Fix
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3969 getScript ‘unsafe-inline’
  - Two main concerns: using script tags for local scripts like we do with crossDomain scripts will avoid the CSP violation, but we also need to think about execution order in the case of script tags for when domManip executes scripts from HTML. Using script tags for local scripts will also fix the warning noted in the next issue (if async)----->
  - Can recommend crossDomain: true for their case as a workaround
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3975 scripts in loaded HTML are sync
