## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3194 
  - Seems bad to have load code run before ready code?
  - (attaching event outside ready seems okay to me tho)
  - Can Migrate detect this and warn about setting a load handler in a ready handler?
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3193
  - Do we just live with this? If not, how do we "fix" it?
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3187
  - Leave as a wontfix? 
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3174 
  - readyList.then(fn).catch(err => jQuery.readyException(err)) or some such
  - Default would be to log and rethrow (so it remains unhandled)

## Angular issue
* https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/v1.5.7/src/angular.suffix 
  - Init is wrapped in a ready and `throw new Error()` swallowed
  - Switching to always use ready-no-deferred would fix this?

## Should we move our wontfix page? (Dave)
  - https://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/
  - Maybe to our own repo's wiki? Seems related to the info there

## BrowserStack
* IE 6 automated tests removed completely -- YAY!
* https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#browser-support - the browser support changes policy - only on majors? Decide.

## 3.0.1
* Issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.1 

## What is codacy-bot and why is it talking on our PRs?
* Thoughts about whether this is useful?
  - It’s running on custom settings incompatible with our code… e.g. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3202/files/37e5e0d9f1c3f2261071019db84bf5e1f5e9135b#r68554905 
  - Let's block it for now, we can do our own code complexity metrics

## Migrate
* 3.x
  - No critical issues for 3.0.1 yet
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/198
  - m_gol any issues you've seen with Angular?
