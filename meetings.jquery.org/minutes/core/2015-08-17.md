## Change to .map() (don’t flatten results)
* Done this for a long time. Probably too disruptive.
* Maybe not used a lot
* not 3.0

## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2541 Cache ‘node_modules’ in Travis
* https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/345 - don’t assume browser globals in Sizzle?
