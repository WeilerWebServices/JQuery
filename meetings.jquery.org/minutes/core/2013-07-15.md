## Switchover to Bower (timmywil)
* Change is made for master and 1.x-master
* Working for everyone?
* Issues?
  - Our build process with bower is fine, Sizzle and QUnit
  - Can't publish jQuery to Bower yet tho
  - Need to wait until they are released
  - Current Bower package forces Migrate on everyone
  - Wait for Bower update

## npm version
* need a change to module.exports, wait for 2.0.4

## Problems with Jenkins/testswarm
* Post to .html pages is too error prone
* Causing AJAX fail
  - Create a PHP-based page to get test files (dave)

## jQuery 1.11/2.1
* Dave didn't summarize the doc yet
* make .ready() optional in its own module
  - solves the cross-dependency issue nicely!
