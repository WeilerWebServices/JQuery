## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4150
  - Would it break anything to have prefilters applied before data conversion?
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4154 add :hover support?
  - This may be moot if we move towards a more native-based selector engine, but *can* we support this in Sizzle with current browsers?
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4155 
  - Border-box + width attribute doesnâ€™t work in iOS7
  - Seems to be fixed already in newer versions of iOS. Only fix the test?

## http://swarm.jquery.org/job/7504 
* CSS in iOS 7: zoom issue
* Manip in Edge: issue with module script loading
  - mgol to disable these tests in Edge. Changes to jQuery are unlikely.
* Dimensions in IE9: issue with scrollbars
* Dimensions in iOS7: issue with new SVG tests

## Others
* Spam on IRC, should we require registration? yes
