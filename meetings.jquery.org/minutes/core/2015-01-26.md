## jQuery 3.0 beta
* Still to do:
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+no%3Aassignee
* jquery-release (timmywil tickets)
  - Doesn't like a 3.0.0 build?
  - Current code hasn't been vetted for major-version release
  - May still work but needs to be tested

## Purpose of _evalURL
* If you replace ajax.js with some other stack, it needs to define _evalURL so that manipulation can run scripts in HTML strings.
* (Unless you want to explicitly deny that perhaps?)
* markelog to add comment so we won't forget (again)

## Pull Requests and Issues
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0
* offsetParent is wrong for 3D transforms
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1765
  - Proposed solution is going to be slower, not sure of real life impact
  - Standard is not yet final
  - Browser should really do this automatically and reflect the correct value
  - bzbarsky says offsetParent is a legacy thing tho
  - Brings up the whole issue of whether to use gBCR everywhere in place of offsetTop/Left
  - Defer this until 4.0, too much potential for breakage and need to explore it
* Data: rwaldron volunteered to work on it
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1428
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1668 ready to land
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1905 Needs a master version and rebase
  - ping rwaldron
