## Issues and PRs
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1969
  - Is unescaped \f valid in an XHTML document attribute value?
  - Is there some way we can avoid constant XHTML issues? Can we test in XHTML perhaps for an occasional run?
  - m_gol to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1731
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1967
  - jQuery.support.cors is in relatively wide use (but not formally documented) for situations like PhoneGap and IE local apps
  - Can this be fixed by selecting XHR as a default transport?
  - Continue discussion on the ticket
