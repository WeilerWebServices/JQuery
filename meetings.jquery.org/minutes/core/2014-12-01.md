## Issues and PRs
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1874
 - Just land a fix, no unit test since it's a resource leak
 - Landed in Sizzle
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1867
 - .detail used in all mouse events, now inclined to just add it
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1855
 - Just always use gBCR? 
 - Maybe a bit slower but would provide fractional dimensions for width/height
 - Does gBCR also fix offset/position/width/height when elements are transformed? Need to check

## Promises/A+ compat
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1821
 - make .then() as Promise/A+ compat as it can be
 - may be a few minor behavioral things not std
 - what about extensions to the Promise/A+ spec? (context, multiple values, progress)
 - seems like we need multi values for the most common use case of $.ajax	
 - keep other Deferred behavior basically unchanged
 - no need to introduce breaking changes
 - current Deferred functionality won't be enhanced e.g., https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1839
