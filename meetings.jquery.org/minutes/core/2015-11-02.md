## Issues needing review

## PRs
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2682 Ajax: binary data response
  - Dave to check on using gibson’s suggestion
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2671 Ajax: form-encode requests with a body
  - Merge
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2684 Ajax: add onabort handler
  - I didn’t see an easy way to adjust the status text. The error callback seemed more appropriate for 2 reasons: it matches compat behavior and we don’t want to call native abort again.
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/pull/111 Browser support page update
