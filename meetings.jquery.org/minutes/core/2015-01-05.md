## jQuery 3.0 beta
* Still a LOT to do
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+no%3Aassignee

## Pull Requests and Issues
* indexOf
 - Seems good to have a consistent standard
 - Would need to be addressed in the style guide?
 - In the meantime, land the two PRs
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1980
 - land this, we can tweak
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1975
 - Can we eliminate $.support.cors and use XHR as the default transport if no other transport works?
 - Would eliminate a lot of special cases
 - Pinged @jaubourg on the possibility
* Skip PATCH tests on BrowserStack
 - too many spurious fails from their setups for some reason
