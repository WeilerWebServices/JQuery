## 1.11.2/2.1.2 release
* All patches landed? They should all be here:
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=milestone%3A1.11.2%2F2.1.2
* Trac tickets listed under a single GH issue
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1662 was master only
* Sizzle has been updated in master, compat, 2.1-stable, and 1.11-stable
* Add Ajax URL sanitization?
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1875
 - No, let's leave until 3.0, there are compat risks
* Release ASAP
* Need blog post draft
* Has jquery-release been updated to not copy -latest? I think so
 - (in general, any changes to jquery-release needed?)

## 3.0 release - target mid-January
* Major blockers or unassigned tickets?
* Should we switch to ES6 module format for authoring?
 - Can still generate both the monolithic file and AMD from that
 - Move AMD modules to dist/AMD
 - Breaks the build process, can’t use r.js or var modules
 - Can’t load modules when testing
 - Decided to not change authoring for 3.0 … wait for 4.0, better tooling and/or browser support before using ES6 for authoring
* QUnit ticket: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/707 

## Issues vs Pull Requests
* Let's use issues (only) for changelog
* PRs should have one or more issues, unless they're housekeeping (e.g. typos and such) in which case we don't need an issue
* Need a commit message format change here?
* gibson042 has Component name enforcement
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1909
* Support for jquery-release to build changelog
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/issues/1

## Issues and PRs
* Promises/A+ compat
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1821 
 - gibson042 to work on a PR
 - maximum backcompat, allow setting context, multiple resolved values, etc. (Promise/A compat for code that draws inside the standard lines)
 - Use a plugin to handle the error cases?
 - Might be able to use try/finally now that IE7 has been dropped
* Plain Objects
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1776
 - Do we support animation on Object
 - https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/600
 - Are the docs/units correct and complete compared to code?	
 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1668
 - Should we hide the expando on plain objects? Let's try exposing it and see if anyone depends on it
 - Should we add .animate() and .queue() to the list of things supported for plain objects?
 - .queue - yes, support on plain objects, little impact
 - .animate() - let's look at velocity.js, although it may be as simple as guarding stuff with .nodeType checks
