## Deprecate <1.11 npm versions
* Syntax: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/deprecate 
* "Versions of the jquery npm package older than 1.9.0 are patched versions that don't work in web browsers. Please upgrade to >=1.11.0."
* Look into which of the latest versions do work on web browsers
* It should be: old Node-based <=1.8, new ours >=1.11 but 1.9.1 has been published 2 months after 1.11.1, whatâ€™s up about that?
  - I recall publishing an older version because it was completely absent.
