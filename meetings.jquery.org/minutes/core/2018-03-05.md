## Issues needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3991 isBorderBox + forced reflow
  - If the logic is functional, I’m fine with avoiding isBorderBox when possible
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3977 isAttached
  - LGTM
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3902 ajax URLs cache: false
  - The var files are unnecessary, but if gibson approves, that’s the only request from me.
  - Needs more changes
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3868 change tests to html5
  - Yes, since the doctype we have actually triggers quirksmode!
  - Needs to change more doctypes
  - Address XHTML testing elsewhere
