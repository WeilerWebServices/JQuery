## jQuery 3.0 beta
* Still to do:
  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+no%3Aassignee
* jquery-release (timmywil tickets)
  - Doesn't like a 3.0.0 build?
  
## Style of cherry-picked commits
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/e2ec5da2a7f1b3de1f9dc7e2c01f27cd23714e60#commitcomment-9253725
* Let's do `git cherry-pick -x` and keep the comments, be sure to cp into compat rather than the other way around

## $.when changes for single-argument case
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2018
* Definitely should eliminate the reuse of the incoming Deferred for the return value
* What about when the single arg is an Array? Keep current behavior, too big an API break
* Basically, one arg is Promise.cast(), multiple is Promise.all()
* Need better docs for $.when if an array is passed

## Formatting ticket and issue references
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/85ffc6d973865a031ded170934e0acfc2e97cb11#commitcomment-9260170
* Dave turned off the Trac commit hook
* Reference older Trac issues with trac-1234
* Is it safe to reference Github issues and PRs with # instead of gh- now?
* No, could get confusing
* Decided: use gh-xxxx and trac-xxxx for consistency and back-compat (in core)

## Build on Windows
* The node-smoke-test won't work on Windows and node 0.10 without a bunch of stuff installed incluing Visual Studio
* Fixed with io.js or node 0.12 but who knows when they arrive
* For now, can work around with `grunt dev`, ignore `npm install` error that doesn't affect the working of other things
