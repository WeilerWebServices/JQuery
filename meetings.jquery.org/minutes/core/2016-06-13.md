## jQuery 4.0 event changes WIP
* Using one aEL per jQuery event and native event object:
* https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/commits/v4-native-events 
* Seems to pass jQuery UI unit tests
* Not too many fails in our units: http://imgur.com/tewiRFR 
* Issues with stopPropagation on delegated events, success depends on whether the delegated ones are attached first since we're doing 1:1 handlers
* Could we use a capturing handler somehow to fix this? (jbedard)
* Still need to review use of jQuery.event.special and .trigger()
* Can we use native event for .trigger() and not even do our own bubbling in most cases?
