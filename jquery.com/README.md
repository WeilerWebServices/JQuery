# jquery.com

This repo contains the source for ```https://jquery.com```, which is primarily the introductory site and a location for developers to easily download jQuery for use on a web site. It is not the appropriate place to report code bugs or documentation errors. For programming help, or if you are unsure of whether you have found a bug or documentation issue, we recommend that you start on a help forum such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Documentation issues should be reported at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/ and code bugs can be reported at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/.
